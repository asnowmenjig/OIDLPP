to inarch v a in and arch
inarching is a method of grafting which is commonly
called grafting by approach this method of grafting is used
when the stock and the tree may be joined take the branch
you would inarch and having fitted it to that part of the stock
where you intend to join it pare away the rind and wood on
one side about three inches in length after the same manner
cut the stock or branch in the place where the graft is to be
united so that they may join equally together that the sap may
meet then cut a little tongue upwards in the graft and make
a notch in the stock to admit it so that when they are joined
the tongue will prevent their slipping and the graft will more
closely unite with the stock having thus placed them exactly
together tie them  then cover the place with grafting clay
to prevent the air from entering to dry the wound or the wet
from getting in to rot the stock you should fix a stake into
the ground to which that part of the stock as also the graft
should be fastened to prevent the wind from breaking them
asunder in this manner they are to remain about four
months in which time they will be sufficiently united and
the graft may then be cut from the mothertree observing to
slope it off close to the stock and cover the joined parts with
fresh grafting clay the operation is always performed in
april or may and is commonly practised upon oranges myr

of the justices errants commonly called the great affizes
and in the quartersessions and in them it is most ordinarily
called a jury and that in civil causes whereas in other
courts it is often termed an inquest in the general assize
there are usually many juries because there be store of causes
both civil and criminal commonly to be tried whereof one
is called the grand jury and the rest petit juries the grand
jury consists ordinarily of twentyfour grave and substantial
gentlemen or some of them yeomen chosen indifferently
out of the whole shire by the sheriff to consider of all bills
of indictment preferred to the court  which they do either
approve by writing upon them these words billa vera or dis
allow by writing ignoramus such as they do approve if
they touch life and death are farther referred to another jury
to be considered of because the case is of such importance 
but others of lighter moment are upon their allowance
without more work fined by the bench except the party
traverse the indictment or challenge it for insufficiency or
remove the cause to a higher court by certiorari  in which
two former cases it is referred to another jury and in the lat
ter transmitted to the higher those that pass upon civil
causes real are all or so many as can conveniently be had
of the same hundred where the land or tenement in question
doth lie and four at the least and they upon due exami
nation bring in their verdict either for the demandant or te
nant according unto which judgment passeth afterward in
the court where the cause first began and the reason hereof
is because these justices of assize are in this case for the
ease of the countries only to take the verdict of the jury by
the virtue of the writ called nisi prius and so return it to the
court where the cause is depending cowel
