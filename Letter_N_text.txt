• nature sometimes means the authour of nature or natura
fiatur ans as rature hath made man partly corporeal and
partly immaterial for nature in this sense may be used the
word creator 
nature sometimes means that on whose account a thing is
what it is and is called as when we define the nature of an
angle for nature in this sense may be used offence or quality
nature sometimes means what belongs to a living creature
at its nativity or accrues to it by its birth as when we say a
man is noble by nature or a child is naturally forward this
may be expressed by saying the man was born so  or the thing
was generated such
nature sometimes means an internal principle of local mo
tion as we say the stone falls or the flame rises by nature
for this we may say that the motion up or down is spontaneous
or produced by its proper cause
mature sometimes means the established course of things cor
poreal as nature makes the night succeed the day this
may be termed established order or settled course
nature means sometimes the aggregate of the powers be
longing to a body especially a living one  as when physi
cians say that nature is firong or nature left to herself will
do the cure for this may be used comitution temperament
or ruclure of the body
nature is put likewise for the system of the corporeal works
