chameleon ns xzooxsww
the chameleon has four feet and on each foot three claws
its tail is long with this as well as with its feet it fastens
itself to the branches of trees its tail is flat its nose long
in an obtuse point its back is sharp its skin plaited and
jagged like a saw from the neck to the last joint of the tail
and upon its head it has something like a comb like a fish

air but it bas been observed to feed on flies catched with its
tongue which is about ten inches long and three thick
made of white flesh round but flat at the end  or hollow
and open resembling an elephants trunk it also shrinks
and grows longer this animal is said to assume the colour
of those things to which it is applied  but our modern ob
servers assure us that its natural colour when at rest and in
the shade is a bluish grey though some are yellow and
others green but both of a smaller kind when it is ex
posed to the sun the grey changes into a darker grey inclin
ing to a dun colour and its parts which have least of the
light upon them are changed into spots of different colours
the grain of its skin when the light doth not shine upon it
is like cloth mixed with many colours sometimes when it
is handled it seems speckled with dark spots inclining to
green if it be put upon a black hat it appears to be of a
violet colour and sometimes if it be wrapped up in linen
it is white but it changes colour only in some parts of the
body calmet
a chameleon is a creature about the bigness of an ordinary
lizard his head unproportionably big and his eyes great he

little tumours less eminent nearer the belly his tail slender
and long on each foot he hath five fingers three on the out
side and two on the inside his tongue of a marvellous length

com et m s scorneta latin a hairy star
a heavenly body in the planetary region appearing sud
denly and again disappearing  and during the time of its ap
pearance moving through its proper orbit like a planet
the orbits of comets are ellipses having one of their foci in
the center of the fun  and being very long and eccentrick
they become invisible when in that part most remote from the
sun comets popularly called blazing stars are distinguished
from other stars by a long train or tail of light always op
posite to the sun  hence arises a popular division of comts
into three kinds bearded tailed and haired comets though
the division rather relates to the different circumstances of the
same comet than to the phaenomena of the several thus
when the comet is eastward of the sun and moves from it
the comet is said to be bearded barbatus because the light
matches before it when the light is westward of the sun
the comit is said to be tailed because the train follows it
when the comet and the sun are diametrically opposite the
earth being between them the train is hid behind the body of
the comet excepting a little that appears around it in form
of a border of hair hence called crinitus
according to sir isaac newton the tail of a comet is a
very thin vapour emitted by the head or nucleus of the co
met ignited by the neighbourhood to the sun and this va
pour is furnished by the atmosphere of the comet the va
pours of comets being thus dilated rarefied and diffused may
probably by means of their own gravity be attracted down
to the planets and become intermingled with their atmo
spheres for the conservation of the water and moisture of
the planets comets seem absolutely requisite from whose con
jensed vapours and exhalations all that moisture which is
spent in vegetations and putrefactions and turned into dry
earth may be resupplied and recruited for all vegetables in
crease wholly from fluids and turn by putrefaction into
orth honoe the quantity of dry earth must continually in
crease and the moisture of the globe decrease and at last be
‘suite evaporated if it have not a continual supply and i
spot adds sir isaac that the spirit which makes the finest
subsilest and best part of our air and which is absolutely re
quisite for the life and being of all things comes principally
from the comets
the same great author has computed that the suns heat
the comet 9f 1680 was to his heat with us at midsummer
ntyeight thousand to one and that the heat of the body
of the “met was near two thousand times as great as that of
in
redhot iron he also calculates that a globe of redh
iron of the dimensions of our earth would scarce be o o
fifty thousand years if then the comet be supposed i
a hundred times as fast as redhot iron yet since its heat o
a thousand times greater supposing it of the bigness of o
earth it would not be cool in a million of years e

corrosion is a particular species of dissolution of bodies
either by an acid or a saline menstruum it is almost wholly
designed for the resolution of bodies most strongly compostcd
as bones and metals so that the menstruums here employed
have a considerable moment or force these liquors whe
ther acid or urinous are nothing but salts dissolved in a little
phlegm  therefore these being solid and consequently con
taining a considerable quantity of matter do both attract one
another more and are also more attracted by the particles of
the body to be dissolved so when the more solid bodies are
put into saline menstruums the attraction is stronger than in
other solutions  and the motion which is always proportional
to the attraction is more violent  so that we may easily con
ceive when the motion is in such a manner increased it
should drive the salts into the pores of the bodies and open
and loosen their cohesion though ever so firm słuing

crystallization m s from crystallize
1 congelation into crystals 
such a combination of saline particles as resembles the
form of a crystal variously modified according to the nature
and texture of the salts the method is by dissolving any
saline body in water and filtering it to evaporate ’till a film
appear at the top and then let it stand to shoot and this it
does by that attractive force which is in all bodies and parti
cularly in salt by reason of its solidity whereby when the
menstruum or fluid in which such particles flow is sated
enough or evaporated so that the saline particles are within
each others attractive powers they draw one another more
than they are drawn by the fluid then will they run into cry
stals and this is peculiar to those that let them be ever so
much divided and reduced into minute particles yet when
they are formed into crystals they each of them reassume
their proper shapes so that one might as easily divest them of
their saltness as of their figure this being an immutable and
perpetual law by knowing the figure of the crystals we may
understand what the texture of the particles ought to be
which can form those crystals and on the other hand by
knowing the texture of the particles may be determined the
figure of the crystals ampuincy
