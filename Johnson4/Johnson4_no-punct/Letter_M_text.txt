maner armorick
asanor signifies in common law a rule or government
which a man hath over such as hold land within his fee
touching the original of these manors it seems that in the
beginning there was a certain compass of ground granted by
the king to some man of worth for him and his heirs to dwest
upon and to exercise some jurisdiction more or less within
that compass as he thought good to grant performing him
such services and paying such yearly rent for the same
as he by his grant required  and that afterward this great
man parcelled his land to other meaner men injoining them
again such services and rents as he thought good and by
that means as he became tenant to the king so the inferiors
became tenants to him  but those great men or their poste
rity have alienated these mansions and lands so given them
by their prince and many for capital offences have forfeited
them to the king and thereby they still remain in the crown
or are bestowed again upon others but whosoever possesses
these manors the liberty belonging to then is real and prebr xmlnsbr xmlns

thrush which feeds upon the berries of this plant in winter
when it is ripe doth open the seed from tree to tree for the
viscous part of the berry which immediately surrounds the
seed doth sometimes fasten it to the outward art of the birds
beak which to get disengaged of he strikes his be k at the
branches of a neighbouring tree and so leaves the seed sticking
by this viscous matter to the bark which if it lights up in a
smooth part of the tree will fasten itself and the following
winter put out and grow the trees which this plant doth most
readily take upon are the apple the ash and some other
smooth rind trees whenever a branch of an cak tree hath any
of these plants growing upon it it is cut off and preserved by
