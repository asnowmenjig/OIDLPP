is wholly volatile in the fire and may be driven up in vapour

drop may be again divided by the lightest touch into a multi

water as 14ozo to iooo and as it is the heaviest of all fluids
it is also the coldest and when heated the hottest the an
cients all esteemed quicksilver a poison nor was it brought into
internal use till about two hundred and twenty years ago
which was first occasioned by the shepherds who ventured
to give it their sheep to kill worms and as they received no
hurt by it it was soon concluded that men might take it
safely in time the diggers in the mines when they found
it crude swallowed it in vast quantities in order to sell it
privately when they had voided it by stool  but the miners
seldom follow their occupation above three or four years and
