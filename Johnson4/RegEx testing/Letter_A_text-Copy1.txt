2 reformation of life
our lord and saviour was of opinion that they which
would not be drawn to amendment of life by the testimony
which moses and the prophets have given concerning the mi
series that follow sinners after death were not likely to be per
suaded by other means although god from the dead should
have raised them up preachers hooker
behold  famine and plague tribulation and anguish are
sent as scourges for amendment 2 esdras xvi 19
though a serious purpose of amendment and true acts of con
trition before the habit may be accepted by god yet there is
no sure judgment whether this purpose be serious or these acts

ammoni ac m s the name of a drug
gum amm on 1ac is brought from the east indies and is sup
posed to ooze from an umbelliferous plant dioscorides says
it is the juice of a kind of ferula growing in barbary and the
plant is called agasyllis pliny calls the tree metopion which he
says grows near the temple of jupiter ammon whence the
gum takes its name it ought to be in dry drops white with
in yellowish without easily fusible resinous somewhat bitter
and of a very sharp taste and smell somewhat like garlick
this gum is said to have served the ancients for incense in
their sacrifices savary trevoux
sal amm on 1ac is a volatile salt of two kinds ancient and mo
dern the ancient sort described by pliny and dioscorides
was a native salt generated in those large inns where the
crouds of pilgrims coming from the temple of jupiter am
mon used to lodge  who travelling upon camels and those
creatures in cyrene where that celebrated temple stood
urining in the stables or in the parched sands out of this
urine which is remarkably strong arose a kind of salt deno
minated sometimes from the temple ammoniac and sometimes
from the country cyreniac no more of this salt is produced
there and from this deficiency some suspect there never
was any such thing but this ao is removed by the
large quantities of a salt nearly of the same nature thrown
out by mount aetna
the modern sal ammoniac is made in egypt where long
necked glass bottles filled with foot a little sea salt and
the urine of cattle and having their mouths luted with a picce
of wet cotton are placed over an oven or furnace in a thick
bed of ashes nothing but the necks appearing and kept there
two days and a night with a continual strong fire the
steam swells up the cotton and forms a paste at the vent
hole hindering the salts from evaporating  which stick to
the top of the bottle and are taken out in those large cakes
which they send to england only soot exhaled from dung
is the proper ingredient in this preparation  and the dung of
camels affords the strongest
our chymists imitate the egyptian sal ammoniac by adding
one part of common salt to five of urine  with which some
mix that quantity of foot and putting the whole in a vessel
they raise from it by sublimation a white friable farina
ceous substance which they call sal ammoniac chambers
amm on 1’acal adj from ammoniac having the properties
of ammoniac salt
human blood calcind yields no fixed salt nor is it a sal
ammoniack for that remains immutable after repeated distil
lations and distillation destroys the ammoniacal quality of ani
mal salts and turns them alkaline so that it is a salt neither
quite fixed nor quite volatile nor quite acid nor quite alka
line nor quite ammoniacal but soft and benign approaching
nearest to the nature of sal ammoniac arkathnat

amputation m s samputatio lat
the operation of cutting off a limb or other part of the
body the usual method of performing it in the instance
of a leg is as follows the proper part for the operation
being four or five inches below the knee the skin and flesh
are first to be drawn very tight upwards and secured from
returning by a ligature two or three fingers broad above
this ligature another loose one is passed for the gripe which
being twisted by means of a stick may be straitened to any
degree at pleasure then the patient being conveniently
fituated and the operator placed to the inside of the limb
which is to be held by one assistant above and another be
low the part designed for the operation and the gripe suffi
ciently twisted to prevent too large an haemorrhage the flesh
is with a stroke or two to be separated from the bone with
the dismembering knife then the periostium being also
divided from the bone with the back of the knife saw the
bone asunder with as few strokes as possible when two
parallel bones are concerned the flesh that grows between
them must likewise be separated before the use of the saw
this being done the gripe may be slackened to give an op
portunity of searching for the large blood vessels and securing
the homorrhage at their mouths after making proper ap
plications to the stump loosen the first ligature and pull both
the skin and the flesh as far as conveniently may be over

conveying the blood from the heart to all parts of the body
each artery is composed of three coats of which the first seems

the coats of the artery the second is made up of circular or
rather spiral fibres of which there are more or fewer strata ac
cording to the bigness of the artery these fibres have a
strong elasticity by which they contract themselves with
some force when the power by which they have been stretch
ed out ceases the third and inmost coat is a fine transpa
rent membrane which keeps the blood within its canal that
otherwise upon the dilatation of an artery would easily se
parate the spiral fibres from one another as the arteries
grow smaller these coats grow thinner and the coats of the
veins seem only to be continuations of the capillary arteries
