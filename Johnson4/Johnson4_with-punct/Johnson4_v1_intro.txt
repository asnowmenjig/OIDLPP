*rt is the fate of those who toil at the lower employments of life, to be rather driven by the fear
of evil, than attracted by the prospect of good; to be exposed to censure, without hope of praise;
to be disgraced by miscarriage, or punished for neglect, where success would have been without
applause, and diligence without reward,
among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries; whom mankind have confidered, not
as the pupil, but the slave of science, the pionier of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish and
clear obstructions from the paths through which learning and genius press forward to conquest and
glory, without bestowing a smile on the humble drudge that facilitates their progress. every other
authour may aspire to praise; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach, and even this negative
recompense has been yet granted to very few. **
i have, notwithstanding this discouragement, attempted a dictionary of the english language, which,
while it was employed in the cultivation of every species of literature, has itself been hitherto neglected;
suffered to spread, under the direction of chance, into wild exuberance; resigned to the tyranny of
time and fashion; and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation.
when i took the first survey of my undertaking, i found our speech copious without order, and
energetick without rules: wherever i turned my view, there was perplexity to be disentangled, and
confusion to be regulated; choice was to be made out of boundless variety, without any established
principle of selection; adulterations were to be detected, without a settled test of purity; and modes
of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages of any writers of classical reputation or
acknowledged authority.
having therefore no assistance but from general grammar, i applied myself to the perusal of our
writers; and noting whatever might be of use to ascertain or illustrate any word or phrase, accu-
mulated in time the materials of a dictionary, which, by degrees, i reduced to method, establishing
to myself, in the progress of the work, such rules as experience and analogy suggested to me; expe-
rience, which practice and observation were continually increasing; and analogy, which, though in
forme words obscure, was evident in others. -
in adjusting the ort hog raphy, which has been to this time unsettled and fortuitous, i found it
necessary to distinguish those irregularities that are inherent in our tongue, and perhaps coeval with
it, from others which the ignorance or negligence of later writers has produced. every language
has its anomalies, which, though inconvenient, and in themselves once unnecessary, must be tolerated
among the imperfections of human things, and which require only to be registered, that they may not
be increased, and ascertained, that they may not be jo. but every language has likewise its
improprieties and absurdities, which it is the duty of the lexicographer to correct or proscribe.
as language was at its beginning merely oral, all words of necessary or common use were spoken
before they were written; and while they were unfixed by any visible signs, must have been spoken
with great diversity, as we now observe those who cannot read to catch sounds imperfeotly, and utter
them negligently. when this wild and barbarous jargon was first reduced to an alphabet, every penman
endeavoured to express, as he could, the sounds which he was accustomed to pronounce or to receive,
and vitiated in writing such words as were already vitiated in speech. the powers of the letters,
when they were applied to a new language, must have been vague and unsettled, and therefore
different hands would exhibit the same sound by different combinations.
from this uncertain pronunciation arise in a great part the various diale&amp;ts of the same country, which
will always be observed to grow fewer, and less different, as books are multiplied; and from this arbi-
trary representation of sounds by letters, proceeds that diversity of spelling observable in the saxon
remains, and i suppose in the first books of every nation, which perplexes or destroys analogy, and
produces anomalous formations, that, being once incorporated, can never be afterward dismissed or
reformed.
of this kind are the derivatives length from long, strength from strong, darling from dear, breadth
from broad, from dry, drought, and from high, height, which milton, in zeal for analogy, writes
highth; quid te exempta juvat spinio de pluribus una; to change all would be too much, and to change
one is nothing,
this

this uncertainty is most frequent in the vowels, which are so capriciously pronounced, and so
differently modified, by accident or affectation, not only in every province, but in every mouth, that
to them, as is well known to etymologists, little regard is to be shewn in the deduction of one language
from another.
such defects are not errours in orthography, but spots of barbarity impressed so deep in the english
language, that criticism can never wash them away: these, therefore, must be permitted to remain
untouched; but many words have likewise been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance, as the
pronunciation of the vulgar has been weakly followed ; and some still continue to be variously
written, as authours differ in their care or skill: of these it was proper to enquire the true ortho-
graphy, which i have always confidered as depending on their derivation, and have therefore referred
them to their original languages: thus i write enchant, enchantment, enchanter, after the french, and
incantation after the latin; thus entire is chosen rather than intire, because it passed to us not from
the latin integer, but from the french entier.
of many words it is difficult to say whether they were immediately received from the latin or
the french, since at the time when we had dominions in france, we had latin service in our churches.
it is, however, my opinion, that the french generally supplied us; for we have few latin words,
among the terms of domestick use, which are not french; but many french, which are very remote
from latin. -
even in words of which the derivation is apparent, i have been often obliged to sacrifice uniformity
to custom; thus i write, in compliance with a numberless majority, convoy and inveigh, deceit and
receipt, fancy and phantom; sometimes the derivative varies from the primitive, as explain and
explanation, repeat and repetition.
some combinations of letters having the same power are used indifferently without any discoverable
reason of choice, as in choak, choke; {.{. fewel, fuel, and many others; which i have sometimes
inserted twice, that those who search for them under either form, may not search in vain.
in examining the orthography of any doubtful word, the mode of spelling by which it is inserted in
the series of the dictionary, is to be considered as that to which i give, perhaps not often rashly, the pre-
ference. i have left, in the examples, to every authour his own practice unmolested, that the reader may
balance suffrages, and judge between us: but this question is not always to be determined by reputed
or by real learning; some men, intent upon greater things, have thought little on sounds and deriva-
tions; some, knowing in the ancient tongues, have neglected those in which our words are commonly
to be sought. thus hammond writes frciblenes; for feasibleness, because i suppose he imagined it
derived immediately from the latin ; and some words, such as dependant, dependent ; dependance,
dependence, vary their final syllable, as one or another language is present to the writer.
in this part of the work, where caprice has long wantoned without controul, and vanity sought
praise by petty reformation, i have endeavoured to proceed with a scholar's reverence for antiquity, and
a grammarian's regard to the genius of our tongue. i have attempted few alterations, and among those
few, perhaps the greater part is from the modern to the ancient practice; and i hope i may be allowed to
recommend to those, whose thoughts have been perhaps employed too anxiously on verbal singularities,
not to disturb, upon narrow views, or for minute propriety, the orthography of their fathers. it has been
asserted, that for the law to be known, is of more importance than to be right. change, says hooker,
is not made without inconvenience, even from worse to better. there is in constancy and stability
a general and lasting advantage, which will always overbalance the slow improvements of gradual
correotion. much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions of oral utterance,
or copy that which every variation of time or place makes different from itself, and imitate those
changes, which will again be changed, while imitation is employed in observing them.
this recommendation of steadiness and uniformity does not proceed from an opinion, that particular
combinations of letters have much influence on human happiness; or that truth may not be success-
fully taught by modes of spelling fanciful and erroneous: i am not yet so lost in lexicography, 3s to
forget that words are the daughters of earth, and that things are the sons of aeaven. language is only
the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas: i wish, however, that the instrument
might be less apt to decay, and that figns might be permanent, like the things which they denote,
in settling the orthography, i have not wholly neglected the pronunciation, which i have directed,
by printing an accent upon the acute or elevated syllable. it will sometimes be found, that the accent
is placed by the authour quoted, on a different syllable from that marked in the alphabetical series; it
is then to be understood, that custom has varied, or that the authour has, in my opinion, pronounced
wrong. short direetions are sometimes given where the sound of letters is irregular; and if they
are sometimes omitted, defect in such minute observations will be more easily excused, than
superfluity.
in the investigation both of the orthography and fignification of words, their etymology was
necessarily to be considered, and they were therefore to be divided into primitives and derivatives.
a primitive word, is that which can be traced no further to any english roof; thus circumspect, circum-
- - vent,
-

</p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 17</div><p class="text">p r e f a c e.
vent, circumstance, delude, concave, and complicate, though compounds in the latin, are to us primi-
tives. derivatives, are all those that can be referred to any word in jong/ish of greater simplicity.
-
the derivatives i have referred to their primitives, with an accuracy sometimes needless; for who does
not see that remotems; comes from remote, lovey from love, concavity from concave, and demonstrative
from demonslrate; but this grammatical exuberance the scheme of my work did not allow me to repress.
it is of great importance in examining the general fabrick of a language, to trace one word from
another, by noting the usual modes of derivation and inflection; and uniformity must be preserved in
systematical works, though sometimes at the expence of particular propriety,
. among other derivatives i have been careful to insert and clucidate the anomalous plurals of nouns
and preterites of verbs, which in the teutonic dialects are very frequent, and though familiar to those
who have always used them, interrupt and embarrass the learners of our language. o
the two languages from which'our primitives have been derived are the roman and teutonick: under
the roman i comprehend the french and provincial tongues; and under the teutonick range the saxon,
german, and all their kindred dialects. most of our polysyllables are roman, and our words of one
syllable are very often teutonick.
in assigning the roman original, it has perhaps sometimes happened that i have mentioned only the
leto, when the word was borrowed from the french; and considering myself as employed only in
the illustration of my own language, i have not been very careful to observe whether the latin word
be pure or barbarous, or the french elegant or obsolete.
for the teutonic; etymologies i am commonly indebted to yumius and skinner, the only names which
i have forborn to quote when i copied their books; not that i might appropriate their labours or usur
their honours, but that i might spare a perpetual repetition by one general acknowledgment. of these,
whom i ought not to mention but with the reverence due to instructors and benefactors, jonius ap-
pears to have excelled in extent of learning, and skinner in restitude of understanding. janja; was
accurately skilled in all the northern languages, skinner probably examined the ancient and remoter dialects
only by occasional inspection into dictionaries; but the learning of yunius is often of no other use than to
show him a track by which he may deviate from his purpose, to which skinner always pressus forward by
the shortest way. skinner is often ignorant, but never ridiculous : junius is always full of knowledge;
but his variety distracts his judgment, and his learning is very frequently disgraced by his absurdities.
the votaries of the northern muses will not perhaps easily restrain their indignation, when they find
the name of junius thus degraded by a disadvantageous comparison ; but whatever reverence is due to
his diligence, or his attainments, it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness to charge that etymo-
logist with want of judgment, who can seriously derive dream from drama, because life is a drama, and
a drama is a dream ; and who declares with a tone of defiance, that no man can fail to derive moan from
£3. 3., monos, single or solitary, who considers that grief naturally loves to be alone *.
our knowledge of the northern literature is so scanty, that of words undoubtedly teutonick the original
is not always to be found in any ancient language; and i have therefore inserted dutch or german substi-
tutes, which i consider not as radical but parallel, not as the parents, but sisters of the english.
the words which are represented as thus related by descent or cognation, do not always agree in sense;
for it is incident to words, as to their authours, to degenerate from their ancestors, and to change their
manners when they change their country. it is sufficient, in etymological enquiries, if the senses of
kindred words be found such as may easily pass into each other, or such as may both be referred to one
general idea.
the etymology, so for as it is yet known, was easily found in the volumes where it is particu-
- r icely delivered ; and, by proper attention to the rules of derivation, the orthography
was soon adjusted. but to collect the words of our language was a task of greater difficulty: the
dictionaries was immediately apparent; and when they were exhausted, what was yet
wanting must be fought by fortuitous and unguided excursions into books, and gleaned as industry

to proper names ; such as arian, socinian, calvinoff, benedicine, makomstan; but have retained those
of a more general nature, as heatsen, pagan. -
of the terms of art i have received such as could be found either in books of science or technical
dictionaries; and have often inserted, from philosophical writers, words which are supported perhaps
only by a fingle authority, and which being not admitted into general use, stand yet as candidates or
probationers, and must depend for their adoption on the suffrage of futurity.
the words which our authours have introduced by their knowledge of foreign languages, or igno-
rance of their own, by vanity or wantonness, by compliance with fashion or lust of innovation, i have
registred as they occurred, though commonly only to censure them, and warn others against the folly
of naturalizing useless foreigners to the injury of the natives.
i have not rejected any by design, merely because they were unnecessary or exuberant; but have
received those which by different writers have been differently formed, as viscid, and viscidity, viscous,
and visco/ity.
compounded or double words i have seldom noted, except when they obtain a signification different
from that which the components have in their fimple state. thus highwayman, woodman, and £orso-
courser, require an explication; but of thislike or coachdriver no notice was needed, because the pri-
mitives contain the meaning of the compounds.
words arbitrarily formed by a constant and settled analogy, like diminutive adjectives in is, as
greenish, bluish, adverbs in ly, as duly, openly, substantives in nes, as vilenes, faultings, were less dili-
gently sought, and sometimes have been omitted, when i had no authority that invited me to insert
them ; not that they are not genuine and regular offsprings of english roots, but because their relation
to the primitive being always the same, their signification cannot be mistaken.
*
the verbal nouns in ing, such as the keeping of the caffle, the leading of the army, are always
neglected, or placed only to illustrate the sense of the verb, except when they signify things as well as
actions, and have therefore a plural number, as dwelling, living ; or have an absolute and abstract signi-
fication, as colouring, painting, learning.
the participles are likewise omitted, unless, by signifying rather habit or quality than adion, they
take the nature of adjectives; as a thinking man, arman of prudence; a pacing horse, a horse that can
pace: these i have ventured to call participial adjecives. but neither are these always inserted, because
they are commonly to be understood, without any danger of mistake, by consulting the verb.
obsolete words are admitted, when they are found in authours not obsolete, or when they have any
force or beauty that may deserve revival.
as composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a language, i have endeavoured to make some
reparation for the universal negligence of my predecessors, by inserting great numbers of compounded
words, as may be found under after, fore, new, night, fair, and many more. these, numerous as
they are, might be multiplied, but that use and curiosity are here satisfied, and the frame of our
language and modes of our combination amply discovered.
of some forms of composition, such as that by which re is prefixed to note repetition, and on to fig-
nify contrariety or privation, all the examples cannot be accumulated, because the use of these particles,
if not wholly arbitrary, is so little limited, that they are hourly affixed to new words as occasion requires,
or is imagined to require them.
there is another kind of composition more frequent in our language than perhaps in any other, from
which arises to foreigners the greatest difficulty. we modify the signification of many words by a
particle subjoined ; as to come off, to escape by a fetch ; to /a/ on, to attack; to fall off, to apostatize;
to break off, to stop abruptly; to bear out, to justify; to fall in, to comply ; to give over, to cease; to
set off, to embellish; to set in, to begin a continual tenour ; to set out, to begin a course or journey; to
take off, to copy; with innumerable expressions of the same kind, of which some appear wildly irregular,
being so far distant from the sense of the fimple words, that no sagacity will be able to trace the steps by
which they arrived at the present use. these i have noted with great care; and though i cannot flatter
myself that the collection is complete, i believe i have so far assisted the students of our language, that
this kind of phraseology will be no longer insuperable; and the combinations of verbs and particles, by
chance onitted, will be easily explained by comparison with those that may be found.
many words yet stand supported only by the name of bailey, ainsworth, philips, or the contraded
idjos. for dicionaries subjoined; of these i am not always certain that they are read in any book but
the works of lexicographers. of such i have omitted many, because i had never read them; and
many i have inserted, because they may perhaps exist, though they have escaped my notice: they are,
however,
</p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 19</div><p class="text">p. r. e. f. a. c. e.
however, to be yet confidered as resting only upon the credit of former dictionaries. others, which i
confidered as useful, or know to be proper, though i could not at present support them by authoritics,
i have suffered to stand upon my own attestation, claiming the same privilege with my predecessors of
being sometimes credited without proof.
the words, thus selected and disposed, are grammatically considered; they are referred to the different
parts of speech; traced, when they are irregularly inflected, through their various terminations; and 1-
lustrated by observations, not indeed of great or striking importance, separately confidered, but necessary
to the elucidation of our language, and hitherto neglected or forgotten by english grammarians.
that part of my work on which i expe&amp;t malignity most frequently to fasten, is the explomation;
in which i cannot hope to satisfy those, who are perhaps not inclined to be pleased, fince i have not
always been able to satisfy myself. to interpret a language by itself is very difficult; many words
cannot be explained by synonimes, because the idea signified by them has not more than one appella-
tion; nor by paraphrase, because fimple ideas cannot be described. when the nature of things is un-
known, or the notion unsettled and indefinite, and various in various minds, the words by which such
notions are conveyed, or such things denoted, will be ambiguous and perplexed. and such is the fate
of hapless lexicography, that not only darkness, but light, impedes and distresses it; things may be not
only too little, but too much known, to be happily illustrated. to explain, requires the use of terms
less aboruse than that which is to be explained, and such terms cannot always be found; for as nothing
can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known, and evident without proof, so no-hing
can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit a definition.
other words there are, of which the sense is too subtle and evanescent to be fixed in a paraphrase;
such are all those which are by the grammarians termed expletives, and, in dead languages, are suffered
to pass for empty sounds, of no other use than to fill a verse, or to modulate a period, but which are
easily perceived in living tongues to have power and emphasis, though it be sometimes such as no other
form of expression can convey. -
*
my labour has likewise been much increased by a class of verbs too frequent in the english language,
of which the fignification is so loose and general, the use so vague and indeterminate, and the senses
detorted so widely from the first idea, that it is hard to trace them through the maze of variation, to
catch them on the brink of utter inanity, to circumscribe them by any limitations, or interpret them by
any words of distinet and settled meaning; such are bear, break, come, cast, full, get, give, do, put set,
go, run, make, take, turn, throw. if of these the whole power is not accurately delivered, it must be
remembered, that while our language is yet living, and variable by the caprice of every one that speaks
it, these words are hourly shifting their relations, and can no more be ascertained in a dictionary, than
a grove, in the agitation of a storm, can be accurately delineated from its picture in the water. -
the particles are among all nations applied with so great latitude, that they are not easily reducible
under any regular scheme of explication: this difficulty is not less, nor perhaps greater, in english, than
in other languages. i have laboured them with diligence, i hope with success; such at least as can be
expected in a task, which no man, however learned or sagacious, has yet been able to perform.
some words there are which i cannot explain, because i do not understand them; these might have
been omitted very often with little inconvenience, but i would not so far indulge my vanity as to decline
this confession: for when tully owns himself ignorant whether lossus, in the twelve tables, means a
funeral song, or mourning garment; and aristotle doubts whether oùgev;, in the iliad, signifies a mule,
or muleteer, i may surely, without shame, leave some obscurities to happier industry, or future
information.
the rigour of interpretative lexicography requires that the explomation, and the word explained, should
be always reciprocal; this i have always endeavoured, but could not always attain. words are seldom
exactly synonimous; a new term was not introduced, but because the former was thought inadequate:
names, therefore, have often many ideas, but few ideas have many names. it was then necessary to
use the proximate word, for the deficiency of fingle terms can very seldom be supplied by circumlocu-
tion; nor is the inconvenience great of such mutilated interpretations, because the sense may easily be
colle&amp;ted entire from the examples.
in every word of extensive use, it was requisite to mark the progress of its meaning, and show by
what gradations of intermediate sense it has passed from its primitive to its remote and accidental signi-
fication ; so that every foregoing explanation should tend to that which follows, and the series be regu-
larly concatenated from the first notion to the last.
this is specious, but not always practicable; kindred senses may be so interwoven, that the per-
plexity cannot be disentangled, nor any reason be assigned why one should be ranged before the
other. when the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifications, how can a consecutive series
be formed of senses in their nature collateral the shades of meaning sometimes pass imperceptibly
into each other ; so that though on one side they apparently differ, yet it is impossible to mark the
point of conta&amp;t. ideas of the same race, though not exactly alike, are sometimes so little different,
that no words can express the dissimilitude, though the mind easily perceives it, when they are exhi-
bited
</p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 20</div><p class="text">p. r. e. f. a c e.
bited together; and sometimes there is such a confusion of acceptations, that discernment is wearied,
and distinetion puzzled, and perseverance herself hurries to an end, by crouding together what ille
cannot separate.
these complaints of difficulty will, by those that have never confidered words beyond their popular
use, be thought only the jargon of a man willing to magnify his labours, and procure veneration to
his studies by involution and obscurity. but every art is obscure to those that have not learned it': this
uncertainty of terms, and commixture of ideas, is well known to those who have joined philosophy with
rammar; and if i have not expressed them very clearly, it must be remembered that i am speaking of
that which words are insufficient to explain.
the original sense of words is often driven out of use by their metaphorical acceptations, yet must
be inserted for the sake of a regular origination. thus i know not whether ardour is used for maze-
rial aeat, or whether flagrant, in english, ever signifies the same with burning; yet such are the pri-
mitive ideas of these words, which are therefore set first, though without examples, that the figurative
senses may be commodiously deduced.
such is the exuberance of signification which many words have obtained, that it was scarcely possible
to colle&amp;t all their senses; sometimes the meaning of derivatives must be sought in the mother term,
and sometimes deficient explanations of the primitive may be supplied in the train of derivation. in
any case of doubt or difficulty, it will be always proper to examine all the words of the same race; for
some words are slightly passed over to avoid repetition, some admitted easier and clearer explanation than
others, and all will be better understood, as they are considered in greater variety of structures and relations.
all the interpretations of words are not written with the same skill, or the same happiness: things
equally easy in themselves, are not all equally easy to any fingle mind. every writer of a long work
commits errours, where there appears neither ambiguity to mislead, nor obscurity to confound him;
and in a search like this, many felicities of expression will be casually overlooked, mony convenient
parallels will be forgotten, and many particulars will admit improvement from a mind utterly unequal
to the whole performance.
but many seeming faults are to be imputed rather to the nature of the undertaking, than the negli-
gence of the performer. thus some explanations are unavoidably reciprocal or circular, as /ind, to
female of ze slag; slag, the male of the hind: sometimes easier words are changed into harder, as buria/
into spillore or in...”ient, drier into discrative, drynos; into soccity or aridity, sit into paroxyson ; for the
easiest word, whatever it be, can never be translated into one more easy. but easiness and difficulty
are merely relative, and if the present prevalence of our language should invite foreigners to this dictio-
nary, many will be assisted by those words which now seem only to increase or produce obscurity. for
this reason i have endeavoured frequently to join a teutonick and roman interpretation, as to chee r, to
glidden, or exhilarate, that every searner of english may be assisted by his own tongue.
the solution of all difficulties, and the supply of all defeots, must be sought in the examples, sub-
joined to the various senses of each word, and ranged according to the time of their authours.
when first i colle&amp;ed these authorities, i was desirous that every quotation should be useful to some
other end than the illustration of a word; i therefore extracted from philosophers principles of science;
from historians remarkable facts; from chymists complete processes; from divines striking exhortations;
and from poets beautiful descriptions. such is defign, while it is yet at a distance from execution.
when the time called upon me to range this accumulation of elegance and wisdom into an alphabetical
series, i soon discovered that the bulk of my volumes would fright away the student, and was forced to
depart from my scheme of including all that was pleasing or useful in english literature, and reduce
my transcripts very often to clusters of words, in which scarcely any meaning is retained; thus to the
weariness of copying, i was condemned to add the vexation of expunging. some passages i have yet
spared, which may relieve the labour of verbal searches, and intersperse with verdure and flowers the
dusty desarts of barren philology.
the examples, thus mutilated, are no longer to be confidered as conveying the sentiments or doctrine
of their authours; the word for the sake of which they are inserted, with all its appendant clauses, has
been carefully preserved; but it may sometimes happen, by hasty detruncation, that the general ten-
dency of the sentence may be changed: the divine may desert his tenets, or the philosopher his system.
some of the examples have been taken from writers who were never mentioned as masters of cic-
gance or models of stile; but words must be sought where they are used ; and in what pages, eminent
for purity, can terms of manufacture or agriculture be found many quotations serve no other purpose,
than that of proving the bare existence of words, and are therefore sclected with less scripulousness
than those which are to teach their structures and relations.
my purpose was to admit no testimony of living authours, that i might not be misled by partiality,
and that none of my cotemporaries might have reason to complain; nor have i departcd from this
resolution, but when some performance of uncommon excellence excited my veneration, when my
memory supplied me, from late books, with an example that was wanting, or when my heart, in the
tenderness of friendship, solicited admission for a favourite name. s

so far have i been from any care to grace my pages with modern decorations, that i have stu-
diously endeavoured to colle&amp;t examples and authorities from the writers before the restoration, whose
works i regard as the wells of english undefiled, as the pure sources of genuine diction. our lan-
guage, for almost a century, has, by the concurrence of many causes, been gradually departing from its
original teutonick character, and deviating towards a gallick structure and phraseology, from which it
ought to be our endeavour to recal it, by making our ancient volumes the ground-work of slile, admit-
ting among the additions of later times, only such as may supply real deficiencies, such as are readily
adopted by the genius of our tongue, and incorporate easily with our native idioms.
but as every language has a time of rudeness antecedent to perfection, as well as of false refinement
and declension, i have been cautious left my zeal for antiquity might drive me into times too re-
mote, and croud my book with words now no longer understood. i have fixed sidney's work for
the boundary, beyond which i make few excursions. from the authours which rose in the time of
elizabeth, a speech might be formed adequate to all the purposes of use and elegance. if the lan-
guage of theology were extracted from hooker and the translation of the bible; the terms of natural
knowledge from bacon; the phrases of policy, war, and navigation from raleigh; the dialect of poetry
and fiction from spenser and sidney; and the diction of common life from shakoshcare, few ideas
would be lost to mankind, for want of english words, in which they might be expressed.
it is not sufficient that a word is found, unless it be so combined as that its meaning is apparently
determined by the tract and tenour of the sentence; such passages i have therefore chosen, and when it
happened that any authour gave a definition of a term, or such an explanation as is equivalent to a
definition, i have placed his authority as a supplement to my own, without regard to the chronological
order, that is otherwise observed.
some words, indeed, stand unsupported by any authority, but they are commonly derivative nouns
or adverbs, formed from their primitives by regular and constant analogy, or names of things seldom
occurring in books, or words of which i have reason to doubt the existence.
there is more danger of censure from the multiplicity than paucity of examples; authorities will
sometimes seem to have been accumulated without necessity or use, and perhaps some will be found,
which might, without loss, have been omitted. but a work of this kind is not hastily to be charged
with superfluities: those quotations, which to careless or unskilful perusers appear only to repeat the
same sense, will often exhibit, to a more accurate examiner, diversities of fignification, or, at least,
afford different shades of the same meaning: one will shew the word applied to persons, another to
things; one will express an ill, another a good, and a third a neutral sense; one will prove the expres-
sion genuine from an ancient authour; another will shew it elegant from a modern : a doubtful autho-
rity is corroborated by another of more credit; an ambiguous sentence is ascertained by a passage clear
and determinate; the word, how often soever repeated, appears with new associates and in different
combinations, and every quotation contributes something to the stability or enlargement of the language.
when words are used equivocally, i receive them in either sense ; when they are metaphorical, i
adopt them in their primitive acceptation.
i have sometimes, though rarely, yielded to the temptation of exhibiting a genealogy of sentiments,
by shewing how one authour copied the thoughts and diction of another: such quotations are indeed
little more than repetitions, which might justly be censured, did they not gratify the mind, by afford-
ing a kind of intellectual history.
the various synta&amp;ical structures occurring in the examples have been carefully noted; the licence or
negligence with which many words have been hitherto used, has made our stile capricious and indeter-
minate; when the different combinations of the same word are exhibited together, the preference is
readily given to propriety, and i have often endeavoured to direct the choice.
thus have i laboured by settling the orthography, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures,
and ascertaining the signification of english words, to perform all the parts of a faithful lexicographer:
but i have not always executed my own scheme, or satisfied my own expe&amp;tations. the work, what-
ever proofs of diligence and attention it may exhibit, is yet capable of many improvements: the ortho-
graphy which i recommend is still controvertible, the etymology which i adopt is uncertain, and per-
haps frequently erroneous; the explanations are sometimes too much contracted, and sometimes too
much diffused, the significations are distinguished rather with subtilty than skill, and the attention is
harrassed with unnecessary minuteness.
the examples are too often injudiciously truncated, and perhaps sometimes, i hope very rarely,
alleged in a mistaken sense; for in making this colle&amp;tion i trusted more to memory, than, in a state of
disquiet and embarrassment, memory can contain, and purposed to supply at the review what was left
incomplete in the first transcription.
many terms appropriated to particular occupations, though necessary and significant, are undoubtedly
omitted; and of the words most studiously considered and exemplified, many senses have escaped observation.
yet these failures, however frequent, may admit extenuation and apology. to have attempted much
is always laudable, even when the enterprize is above the strength that undertakes it: to rest
c below

i
below his own aim is incident to every one whose fancy is active, and whose views are compre-
henfive; nor is any man satisfied with himself because he has done much, but because he can con-
ceive little. when first i engaged in this work, i resolved to leave neither words nor things unexa-
mined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which i should revel away in feasts of literature,
with the obscure recesses of northern learning, which i should enter and ransack; the treasures with
which i expe&amp;ted every search into those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with
which i should display my acquisitions to mankind. when i had thus enquired into the original of
words, i resolved to show likewise my attention to things; to pierce deep into every science, to enquire
the nature of every substance of which i inserted the name, to limit every idea by a definition strictly
logical, and exhibit every production of art or nature in an accurate description, that my book might be
in place of all other dictionaries whether appellative or technical. but these were the dreams of a poet
doomed at last to wake a lexicographer. i soon found that it is too late to look for instruments, when the
work calls for execution, and that whatever abilities i had brought to my task, with those i must finally
serform it. to deliberate whenever i doubted, to enquire whenever i was ignorant, would have pro-
tracted the undertaking without end, and, perhaps, without much improvement; for i did not find by
my first experiments, that what i had not of my own was easily to be obtained: i saw that one enquiry
only gave occasion to another, that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to
find was not always to be informed; and that thus to persue perfection, was, like the first inhabitants
of arcadia, to chace the sun, which, when they had reached the hill where he seemed to rest, was still
beheld at the same distance from them.
i then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries,
which produced more incumbrance than assistance: by this i obtained at least one advantage, that i set
limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not completed.
despondency has never so far prevailed as to depress me to negligence; some faults will at last appear
to be the effects of anxious diligence and persevering attivity. the nice and subtle ramifications of
meaning were not easily avoided by a mind intent upon accuracy, and convinced of the recessity of dis.
entangling combinations, and separating similitudes. many of the distinctions which to common read-
ers appear useless and idle, will be found real and important by men versed in the school philosophy,
without which no dictionary shall ever be accurately compiled, or skilfully examined.
some senses however there are, which, though not the same, are yet so nearly allied, that they are
often confounded. most men think indistincily, and therefore cannot speak with exactness; and con-
sequently some examples might be indifferently put to cither signification: this uncertainty is not to be
imputed to me, who do not form, but regisler the language; who do not teach men how they should
think, but relate how they have hitherto expressed their thoughts.
the imperfeot sense of some examples i lamented, but could not remedy, and hope they will be
compensated by innumerable passages selected with propriety, and preserved with exactness; some
shining with sparks of imagination, and some replete with treasures of wisdom.
the orthography and etymology, though imperfeot, are not imperfect for want of care, but be-
cause care will not always be successful, and recolle&amp;tion or information come too late for use.
that many terms of art and manufacture are omitted, must be frankly acknowledged; but for
this defect i may boldly allege that it was unavoidable: i could not visit caverns to learn the miner's
language, nor take a voyage to perfect my skill in the dialect of navigation, nor visit the warehouses of
merchants, and shops of artificers, to gain the names of wares, tools and operations, of which no men-
tion is found in books; what favourable accident, or easy enquiry brought within my reach, has not
been neglected; but it had been a hopeless labour to glean up words, by courting living information,
o -
and contesting with the sullenness of one, and the roughness of another.
to furnish the academicians della crusa with words of this kind, a series of comedies called
la fiera, or the fair, was professedly written by buonaroti; but i had no such assistant, and
therefore was content to want what they must have wanted likewise, had they not luckily been
so supplied.
nor are all words which are not found in the vocabulary, to be lamented as omissions. of the
laborious and mercantile part of the people, the diction is in a great measure casual and mutable;
many of their terms are formed for some temporary or local convenience, and though current at certain
times and places, are in others utterly unknown. this fugitive cant, which is always in a state of
increase or decay, cannot be regarded as any part of the durable materials of a language, and therefore
must be suffered to perish with other things unworthy of preservation.
care will sometimes betray to the appearance of negligence. he that is catching opportunities which
seldom occur, will suffer those to pass by unregarded, which he expects hourly to return; he that is
searching for rare and remote things, will neglect those that are obvious and familiar: thus many of
the most common and cursory words have been inserted with little illustration, because in gather-
ing the authorities, i forbore to copy those which i thought likely to occur whenever they were wanted.
it is remarkable that, in reviewing my colle&amp;tion, i found the word sea unexemplified.
thus
</p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 23</div><p class="text">p r e f a c e.
thus it happens, that in things difficult there is danger from ignorance, and in things easy from
confidence ; the mind, afraid of greatness, and disdainful of littleness, hastily withdraws herself from
painful searches, and passes with scornful rapidity over tasks not adequate to her powers, sometimes too
fecure for caution, and again too anxious for vigorous effort; sometimes idle in a plain path, and some-
times distracted in labyrinths, and dissipated by different intentions.
a large work is difficult because it is large, even though all its parts might fingly be performed with
facility; where there are many things to be done, each must be allowed its share of time and labour,
in the proportion only which it bears to the whole; nor can it be expected, that the stones which
form the dome of a temple, should be squared and polished like the diamond of a ring.
of the event of this work, for which, having laboured it with so much application, i cannot but
have some degree of parental fondness, it is natural to form conjectures. those who have been per-
suaded to think well of my design, will require that it should fix our language, and put a stop to
those alterations which time and chance have hitherto been suffered to make in it without cpposition.
with this consequence i will confess that i flattered myself for a while ; but now begin to fear that i
have indulged expectation which neither reason nor experience can justify. when we see men grow old
and die at a certain time one after another, from century to century, we laugh at the elixir that promises
to prolong life to a thousand years; and with equal justice may the lexicographer be derided, who
being able to produce no example of a nation that has preserved their words and phrases from muta-
bility, shall imagine that his dictionary can embalm his language, and secure it from corruption and
decay, that it is in his power to change sublunary nature, and clear the world at once from folly, vanity,
and affectation.
with this hope, however, academies have been instituted, to guard the avenues of their languages,
to retain fugitives, and repulse intruders; but their vigilance and activity have hitherto been vain;
sounds are too volatile and subtile for legal restraints; to enchain syllables, and to lash the wind, are
equally the undertakings of pride, unwilling to measure its desires by its strength. the french language
has visibly changed under the inspection of the academy; the stile of amelot's translation of father paul
is observed by le courayer to be un peu posie; and no italian will maintain, that the diction of any
modern writer is not perceptibly different from that of boccace, machiavel, or caro.
total and sudden transformations of a language seldom happen; conquests and migrations are now
very rare: but there are other causes of change, which, though slow in their operation, and invisible in
their progress, are perhaps as much superiour to human resistance, as the revolutions of the sky, or in-
tumescence of the tide. commerce, however necessary, however lucrative, as it depraves the manners,
corrupts the language; they that have frequent intercourse with strangers, to whom they endeavour to
accommodate themselves, must in time learn a mingled dialect, like the jargon which serves the traf-
fickers on the mediterranean and indian coasts. this will not always be confined to the exchange, the
warehouse, or the port, but will be communicated by degrees to other ranks of the people, and be at
last incorporated with the current speech.
there are likewise internal causes equally forcible. the language most likely to continue long with-
out alteration, would be that of a nation raised a little, and but a little above barbarity, secluded from
strangers, and totally employed in procuring the conveniencies of life; either without books, or, like
some of the malometan countries, with very few : men thus busied and unlearned, having only such
words as common use requires, would perhaps long continue to express the same notions by the same
signs. but no such constancy can be expected in a people polished by arts, and classed by subordination,
where one part of the community is sustained and accommodated by the labour of the other. those
who have much leisure to think, will always be enlarging the stock of ideas, and every increase of
knowledge, whether real or fancied, will produce new words, or combinations of words. when the
mind is unchained from necessity, it will range after convenience; when it is left at large in the fields
of speculation, it will shift opinions; as any custom is disused, the words that expressed it must perish
with it; as any opinion grows popular, it will innovate speech in the same proportion as it alters practice.
y
as by the cultivation of various sciences, a language is amplified, it will be more furnished with
words deflected from their original sense; the geometrician will talk of a courtier's zenith, or the ex-
centrick virtue of a wild hero, and the physician of sanguine expectations and phlegmatick delays.
copiousness of speech will give opportunities to capricious choice, by which some words will be pre-
ferred, and others degraded; vicisłitudes of fashion will enforce the use of new, or extend the signifi-
cation of known terms. the tropes of poetry will make hourly encroachments, and the metaphorical
will become the current sense: pronunciation will be varied by levity or ignorance, and the pen must
at length comply with the tongue; illiterate writers will at one time or other, by publick infatuation,
rise into renown, who, not knowing the original import of words, will use them with colloquial licen-
tiousness, confound distinetion, and forget propriety. as politeness increases, some expressions will be
confidered as too gross and vulgar for the delicate, others as too formal and ceremonious for the gay
and airy; new phrases are therefore adopted, which must, for the same reasons, be in time dismissed.
swift, in his petty treatise on the english language, allows that new words must sometimes be intro-
duced, but proposes that none should be suffered to become obsolete. but what makes a word obsolete,
more than general agreement to forbear it and how shall it be continued, when it conveys an offensive
idea, or recalled again into the mouths of mankind, when it has once become unfamiliar by disuse,
and unpleasing by unfamiliarity. - -

there is another cause of alteration more prevalent than any other, which yet in the present state
of the world cannot be obviated. a mixture of two languages will produce a third distinet from
both, and they will always be mixed, where the chief part of education, and the most conspicuous
accomplishment, is skill in ancient or in foreign tongues. he that has long cultivated another lan-
guage, will find its words and combinations croud upon his memory; and haste and negligence, refine-
ment and affectation, will obtrude borrowed terms and exotick expressions.
the great pest of speech is frequency of translation. no book was ever turned from one lan-
guage into another, without imparting something of its native idiom ; this is the most mischievous and
comprehensive innovation; single words may enter by thousands, and the fabrick of the tongue continue
the same, but new phraseology changes much at once ; it alters not the fingle stones of the building,
but the order of the columns. if an academy should be established for the cultivation of our stile,
which i, who can never wish to see dependance multiplied, hope the spirit of english liberty will
hinder or destroy, let them, instead of compiling grammars and dictionaries, endeavour, with all
their influence, to stop the licence of translatours, whose idleness and ignorance, if it be suffered to
proceed, will reduce us to babble a dialeot of france.
if the changes that we fear be thus irresistible, what remains but to acquiesce with silence, as in the
other insurmountable distresses of humanity ? it remains that we retard what we cannot repel, that we
palliate what we cannot cure. life may be lengthened by care, though death cannot be ultimatel
defeated: tongues, like governments, have a natural tendency to degeneration; we have long preserved
our constitution, let us make some struggles for our language.
in hope of giving longevity to that which its own nature forbids to be immortal, i have devoted
this book, the labour of years, to the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm of
philology, without a contest, to the nations of the continent. the chief glory of every people arises from
its authours: whether i shall add any thing by my own writings to the reputation of english literature,
must be left to time: much of my life has been lost under the pressures of disease; much has been
trifled away; and much has always been spent in provision for the day that was passing over me; but i
shall not think my employment useless or ignoble, if by my assistance foreign nations, and distant ages,
gain access to the propagators of knowledge, and understand the teachers of truth; if my labours afford
light to the repositories of science, and add celebrity to bacon, to hooker, to milton, and to boyle.
when i am animated by this wish, i look with pleasure on my book, however defe:tive, and deliver
it to the world with the spirit of a man that has endeavoured well. that it will immediately become
popular i have not promised to myself: a few wild blunders, and risible absurdities, from which no work
of such multiplicity was ever free, may for a time furnish soily with laughter, and harden ignorance in
contempt; but useful diligence will at last prevail, and there never can be wanting some who distinguish
desert; who will confider that no dictionary of a living tongue ever can be perfect, since while it is
hastening to publication, some words are budding, and some falling away; that a whole life cannot be
spent upon syntax and etymology, and that even a whole life would not be sufficient; that he, whose
design includes whatever language can express, must often speak of what he does not understand; that
a writer will sometimes be hurried by eagerness to the end, and sometimes faint with weariness under a
task, which scaliger compares to the labours of the anvil and the mine; that what is obvious is not al-
ways known, and what is known is not always present; that sudden fits of inadvertency will surprize
vigilance, slight avocations will seduce attention, and casual eclipses of the mind will darken learning;
and that the writer shall often in vain trace his memory at the moment of need, for that which yester-
day he knew with intuitive readiness, and which will come uncalled into his thoughts to-morrow.
in this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it not be forgotten that much like-
wife is performed; and though no book was ever spared out of tenderness to the authour, and the
world is little solicitous to know whence proceeded the faults of that which it condemns; yet it may
gratify curiosity to inform it, that the english diaionary was written with little assistance of the learned,
and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities cf retirement, or under the shelter of
academick bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in fickness and in sorrow-. it may repress
the triumph of malignant criticism to observe, that if our language is not here fully displayed, i have
only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed. if the lexicons of ancient
tongues, now immutably fixed, and comprised in a few volumes, be yet, after the toil of successive
ages, inadequate and delusive; if the aggregated knowledge, and co-operating diligence of the italian
academicians, did not secure them from the censure of beni; if the embodied criticks of france, when
fifty years had been spent upon their work, were obliged to change its oeconomy, and give their second
edition another form, i may surely be contented without the praise of perfection, which, if i could
obtain, in this gloom of solitude, what would it avail me? i have protracted my work till most of those
whom i wished to please have sunk into the grave, and success and miscarriage are empty sounds: i
therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquility, having little to fear or hope from censure or from praise.

- any are the works of human industry, which to begin and finish are hardly
granted to the same man. he that undertakes to compile a dictionary,
undertakes that, which, if it comprehends the full extent of his design, he knows him-
self unable to perform. yet his labours, though deficient, may be useful, and with the
hope of this inferior praise, he must incite his activity, and solace his weariness.
perfeotion is unattainable, but nearer and nearer approaches may be made; and
finding my dictionary about to be reprinted, i have endeavoured, by a revisal, to make
it less reprehensible. i will not deny that i found many parts requiring emendation,
and many more capable of improvement. many faults i have correoted, some super-
fluities i have taken away, and some deficiencies i have supplied. i have methodised
some parts that were disordered, and illuminated some that were obscure. yet the
changes or additions bear a very small proportion to the whole. the critic will now
have less to object, but the student who has bought any of the former copies,
needs not repent; he will not, without nice collation, perceive how they differ, and
usefulness seldom depends upon little things,
for negligence or deficience, i have perhaps not need of more apology than the
nature of the work will furnish; i have left that inaccurate which never was made
exact, and that imperfeot which never was completed.

to the britains or welsh were the first
possessors of this island, whose names are re-
corded, and are therefore in civil history al-
ways considered as the predecessors of the present inha-
bitants; yet the deduction of the english language,
from the earliest times of which we have any know-
ledge to its present state, requires no mention of them :
for we have so few words, which can, with any proba-
bility, be referred to british roots, that we justly regard
the saxons and welsh, as nations totally distinet. it has
been conjectured, that when the saxons seized this
country, they suffered the britains to live among them
in a state of vassalage, employed in the culture of the
ground, and other laborious and ignoble services. but
it is scarcely possible, that a nation, however depressed,
should have been mixed with another in considerable
numbers without some communication of their tongue,
and therefore it may, with great reason, be imagined,
that those, who were not sheltered in the mountains,
perished by the sword.
the whole fabrick and scheme of the english lan-
guage is gothick or teutonick: it is a dialect of that
tongue, which prevails over all the northern countries
of europe, except those where the sclavonian is spoken.
of these languages dr. hickes has thus exhibited the
genealogy.
g o t h i c k,
*t | | —s
anglo saxon, francick, cock,
2-a-, r-a- *-
dutch, german. islandick,
frisick, norwegian,
english. swedish,
danish.
of the gothick, the only monument remaining is a
copy of the gospels somewhat mutilated, which, from
the silver with which the characters are adorned, is
called the silver book. it is now preserved at upsal, and
having been twice published before, has been lately re-
printed at oxford, under the inspection of mr. lye, the
editor of junius. whether the diction of this venerable
manuscript be purely gothick, has been doubted ; it
seems however to exhibit the most ancient dialeoł now to
be found of the teutonick race, and the saxon, which is
the original of the present english, was either derived from
it, or both have descended from some common parent.
what was the form of the saxon language, when,
about the year 450, they first entered britain, cannot
now be known. they seem to have been a people
without learning, and very probably without an alpha-
bet; their speech therefore, having been always cursory
and extemporaneous, must have been artless and uncon-
nected, without any modes of transition or involution of
clauses; which abruptness and inconnection may be ob-
served even in their later writings. this barbarity may
be supposed to have continued during their wars with
the britains, which for a time left then no leisure for
softer studies ; nor is there any reason for supposing it
abated, till the year 570, when augustine came foln
rome to convert them to christianity. the christian
religion always implies or produces a certain degree of
civility and learning; they then became by degrees ac-
quainted with the roman language, and so gained, from
time to time, some knowledge and elegance, till in three
centuries they had formed a language capable of ex-
pressing all the sentiments of a civilised people, as
appears by king affred's paraphrase or imitation of
boethius, and his short preface, which i have selected
as the first specimen of ancient english.

translations seldom afford just specimens of a lan-

verbal interpretation is endeavoured, because they retain

this may perhaps be considered as a specimen of the
saxon in its highest state of purity, for here are scarcely
any words borrowed from the roman dialects.
y, t they have often this conv nience, that the same
book, being translated in different ages, affords oppor-
tunity of marking the gradations of change, and bring-
ing one age into con parison with another. for this
purpose i have placed the saxon version and that of
is’ikiff, written about the year 1380, in opposite co-
lumns, because the convenience of easy colla.ion seems
greater than that of regular chronology.
l uk, chap. i.
in the dayes of froude kyng of judee ther was a
prest zacarye by name: of the sort of abia, and his
wyf was of the doughtris of aaron: and hir na:ne was
elizabeth.
2 an bothe weren juste bifore god: goynge in alle
the maundementis and justifyingis of the lord with-
outen playnt.
3 and thei hadden no child, for elizabeth was
bareyn and bothe weren of greet age in her dayes.
4 and it bife! that whanne zacarye schould do the
office of presthod in the ordir of his course to fore
god.
5. aftir the custom of the presthod, he wente forth
by lot and entride into the temple to encensen.
6 and at the multitude of the puple was without
forth and preyede in the our of encenying.
7 and an aungel of the lord apperide to him : and
stood on the right half of the auter of encense.
8 and zacarye feynge was afrayed; and drede fel
upon him.
9 and the aungel sayde to him, zacarye drede thou
not : for thy preier is herd, and elizabeth thi wif schal
bere to thee a fone : and his name schal be clepid jon.
1o and joye and gladyng schal be to thee: and
manye schulen have joye in his natyvyte.
11 for he shal be great bifore the lord: and he
schal not drinke wyn ne sydyr, and he schal be fulfid
with the holy gost yit of his modir wombe.
12 and he schal converte manye of the children of
israel to her lord god.
13 and he schal go bifore in the spiryte and vertu of
helye: and he schal turne the hertis of the fadris to the
sonis, and men out of beleeve : to the prudence of just
men, to make redy a perfyt ouple to the lord.

23 to a maydun weddid to a man : whos name was
joseph of the hous of dauith, and the name of the
maydun was marye.
24 and the aungel entride to hir, and sayde, heil

27 lo thou schalt conseyve in wombe, and schalt

28 this shall be gret: and he schal be clepid the

of the saxon poetry some specimen is necessary,
though our ignorance of the laws of their metre and
the quantities of their syllables, which it would be very
difficult, perhaps impossible, to recover, excludes us
from that pleasure which the old bards undoubtedly
gave to their contemporaries. -
the first poetry of the saxons was without rhyme,
and consequently must have depended upon the quan-
tity of their syllables: but they began in time to imi-
tate their neighbours, and close their verses with cor-
respondent sounds.
the two passages which i have selected, contain
apparently the rudiments of our present lyrick measures,
and the writers may be justly considered as the genuine
ancestors of the english poets.

about the year 1 150, the saxon began to take a
form in which the beginning of the present english may be
plainly discovered; this charge seems not to have been the
cffect of the norman conquest, for very few french words
are found to have been introduced in the first hundred
years after it; the language must therefore have been
altered by causes like those which, notwithstanding the
care of writers and societies instituted to obviate them,
are even now, daily making innovations in every living
language. i have exhibited a specimen of the language
of this age from the year 1 135 to 1140 of the saxon
chronicle, of which the latter part was apparently
written near the time to which it relates.

nearly about this time, the following pieces of poetry
seem to have been written, of which i have inserted
only short fragments; the first is a rude attempt at the
present measure of eight syllables, and the second is a
natural introduction to robert of gloucester, being com-
posed in the same measure, which, however rude and
barbarous it may seem, taught the way to the alexan-
drines of the french poetry.

in these fragments, the adulteration of the sazza
tongue, by a mixture of the norman, becomes appa-
rent; yet it is not so much changed by the admixture of
new words, which might be imputed to commerce with
the continent, as by changes of its own forms and ter-
minations; for which no reason can be given.
hitherto the language used in this island, however
different in successive time, may be called saxon ; nor.
can it be expected, from the nature of things gra-
dually changing, that any time can be assigned, when
the saxon may be said to cease, and the english to com-
mence. robert of gloucester however, who is placed by
the criticks in the thirteenth century, seems to have used
a kind of intermediate diction, neither saxon nor englis ;
in his work therefore we see the transition exhibited,
and, as he is the first of our writers in rhyme, of whom
any large work remains, a more extensive quotation is
extracted. he writes apparently in the same measure
with the foregoing authour of st. margarite, which po-
lished into greater exactness, appeared to our ancestors
so suitable to the genius of the english language, that it
was continued in use almost to the middle of the seven-
teenth century.

sir john mandeville wrote, as he himself informs us, in
the fourteenth century, and his work, which comprising
a relation of many different particulars, consequently
required the use of many words and phrases, may be
properly specified in this place. of the following quo-
tations, i have chosen the first, because it shows, in
some measure, the state of european science as well as
of the english tongue; and the second, because it is
valuable for the force of thought and beauty of ex-
pression.
in that lond, ne in many othere bezonde that, no
man may see the sterre transmontane, that is clept
the sterre of the see, that is unmevable, and that is to-
ward the northe, that we clepen the lode sterre. but
men seen another sterre, the contrarie to him, that is
toward the southe, that is clept antartyk. and right
as the sthip men taken here avys here, and governe hem
be the lode sterre, right so don schip men bezonde the
parties, be the sterre of the southe, the which sterre
apperethe not to us. and this sterre, that is toward
the northe, that wee clepen the lode sterre, ne ap-
perethe not to hem. for whiche cause, men may wel
perceyve, that the lond and the see ben of rowndeschapp
and forme. for the partie of the firmament schewethe
in o contree, that schewethe not in another contree.
and men may well preven be experience and sotyle
compassement of wytt, that zif a man fond passages be
schippes, that wolde go to serchen the world, men
myghtego be schippe alle aboute the world, and aboven
and benethen. the whiche thing i prove thus, aftre
that i have seyh. for i have been toward the parties
of braban, and beholden the astrolabre, that the sterre
that is clept the transmontayne, is 53 degrees highe.
and more forthere in almayne and bewme, it hathe
58 degrees. and more forthe toward the parties sep-
temtrioneles, it is 62 degrees of heghte, and certyn
mynutes. for 1 my self have mesured it by the astro-
labre. now schulle ze knowe, that azen the trans-
montayne, is the tother sterre, that is clept antartyke;
as i have seyci before. and tho 2 sterres ne meeven
nevere. and be hem turnethe alle the firmament, righte
as dothe a wheel, that turnethe be his axille tree: so
that tho sterres beren the firmament in 2 egalle parties;
so that it hathe als mochel aboven, as it hathe benethen.
aftre this, i have gon toward the parties meridionales,
that is toward the southe: and i have founden, that in
lybye, men seen first the sterre antartyk. and so fer
i have gon more in tho contrees, that i have founde that
sterre more highe; so that toward the highe lybye, it
is 18 degrees of heghte, and certeyn minutes (of the
whiche, 60 minutes maken a degree) aftre goynge be
see and be londe, toward this contree, of that i have
spoke, and to other yles and londes bezonde that con-
tree, i have founden the sterre antartyk of 33 degrees
of heghte, and mo mynutes. and zif i hadde had
- -
companye and schippynge, for to go more bezonde, i
trowe wel in certyn, that wee scholde have seen alle the
roundnesse of the firmanent alle aboute. for as have
seyd zou be forn, the half of the firmanent is betwcne
tho 2 sterres: the whiche halfondelle i have feyn. and
of the tother halfondelle, i have scyn toward the northe,
undre the transmontane 62 degrees and to my nutes;
and toward the partie meridionalle, i have seen undre the
antartyk 33 degrees and 16 my nutes: and thanne the
halfondelle of the firmament in alle, he holdethe not
but 180 degrees. and of tho 18o, i have seen 62 on
that o part, and 33 on that other part, that ben 95 de-
grees, and nyghe the halfondelle of a degree; and so
there nefaylethe but that i have seen alle the firmament,
saf 84 degrees and the halfondelle of a degree; and
that is not the fourthe part of the firinament. for the
4 partie of the roundnesse of the firmament holt 90 de-
grees: so there faylethe but 5 degrees and an haif, of
the fourthe partie. and also i have seen the 3 parties
of alle the roundnesse of the firmament, and more zit
5 degrees and an half. be the whiche i feye zou cer-
teynly, that men may envirowne alle the erthe of alle the
world, as wel undre as aboven, and turnen azen to his
contree, that hadde companye and schippynge and con-
duyt: and alle weyes he scholde fynde men, londes, and
yles, als wel as in this contree. for zee wyten welle,
that thei that ben toward the antartyk, theiben streghte,
feet azen feet of hem, that dwellen undre the trans-
montane; als wel as wee and thei that dwellyn under us,
ben feet azenst feet. for alle the parties of see and of
lond han here appositees, habitables or trepasiables, and
thei of this half and bezond half. and wytethe wel,
that aftre that, that i may parceyve and comprehende,
the londes of prestre john, emperour of ynde ben
undre us. for in goynge from scotlond or from eng-
lond toward jerusalem, men gon upward alweys. for
oure lond is in the lowe partie of the erthe, toward the
west : and the lond of prestre john is the low partie
of the erthe, toward the est: and thei han there the
day, whan wee have the nyghte, and also highe to the
contrarie, thei han the nyghte, whan wee han the day.
for the erthe and the see ben of round forme and schapp,
as i have seyd beforn. and than that men gon upward
to o cost, men gon dounward to another cost. also
zee have herd me seye, that jerusalem is in the myddes
of the world; and that may men preven and schewen
there, be a spere, that is pighte in to the erthe, upon
the hour of mydday, whan it is equenoxium, that
schewethe no schadwe on no syde. and that it scholde
ben in the myddes of the world, david wytnessethe it
in the psautre, where he seythe, deus operatus est fa-
lute in medio terre. thanne thei that parten fro the
parties of the west, for to go toward jerusalem, als
many iorneyes as theigon upward for to go thidre, in als
many iorneyes may thei gon fro jerusalem, unto other
confynyes of the superficialtie of the erthe bezonde.
and whan men gon bezonde tho iourneyes, towarde
ynde and to the foreyn yles, alle is envyronynge the
roundnesse of the erthe and of the see, undre oure con-
trees on this half. and therfore hathe it befallen many
tymes of o thing, that i have herd cownted, whan i
was zong; how a worthi man departed sometyme from
oure contrees, for to go serche the world. and so he
passed ynde, and the yles bezonde ynde, where ben ino
than 50ooyles: and so longe he wente be see and lond,
and so enviround the world be many seysons, that he
fond an yle, where he herde speke his owne langage,
callynge on oxen in the plowghe, suche wordes as men
speken to bestes in his owne contree: whereof he hadde
gret mervayle: for he knewe not how it myghte be.
but i seye, that he had gon so longe, be londe and be
see, that he had envyround alle the erthe, that he was
comen azen envirounynge, that is to soye, goynge
aboute, unto his owne marches, zif he wolde have
passed forthe, til he had founden his contree and his
owne knouleche. but he turned azen from thens, from
whens he was come fro; and so he loste moche peyne-
fulle labour, as him self seyde, a gret while astre,
that he was comen hom. for it befelle aftre, that

in that yle, he knew wel, that it was the yle, where he

that men ne mowe not go undre the erthe, and also that
men scholde falle toward the hevene, from undre! but
that may not be, upon lesse, than wee mowe falle toward
hevene, fro the erthe, where wee ben. for fro what
partie of the erthe, that men duelle, outher aboven or
benethen, it semethe alweyes to hem that duellen, that
thei gon more righte than ony other folk. and righte
as it semethe to us, that thei ben undre us, righte so it
semethe hem, that wee ben undre hem. for zif a
man myghte falle fro the erthe unto the firmament; be
grettere-resoun, the erthe and the see, that ben so grete
and so hevy, scholde fallen to the firmament: but that
may not be : and therfore seithe oure lord god, non

for the getnesse of the erthe and of the see, men may
go be a 1 ooo and a 1 ooo other weyes, that no man
cowderedye him perfitely toward the parties that he
cam fro, but zif it were be aventure and happ, or be
the grace of god. for the erthe is fulle large and fulle
gret, and holt in roundnesse and aboute envyroun, be
aboven and be benethen 20425 myles, aftre theopynyoun
of the olde wise astronomeres. and here feyenges 1
repreve noughte. but afte my lytylle wyt, it semethe
me, fivynge here reverence, that it is more. and for
to have bettere understondynge, i seye thus, be ther
ymagyned a figure, that hathe a gret compas; and
aboute the poynt of the gret compas, that is clept the
centre, be made another litille compas : than aftre, be
the gret compass devised be lines in manye parties; and
that alle the lynes meeten at the centre; so that in as
many parties, as the grete compas schal be departed, in
als manye, schalle be departed the litille, that is aboute
the centre, alle be it, that the spaces ben lesse. now
thanne, be the gret compas represented for the firma-
ment, and the litille compas represented for the erthe.
now thanne the firmament is devysed, be astronomeres,
in 12 signes; and every signe is devysed in 30 degrees,
that is 360 degrees, that the firmament hathe aboven.
also, be the erthe devysed in als many parties, as the
firmament; and lat every partye answere to a degree of
the firmament: and wytethe it wel, that afte the
auctoures of astronomye, 7oo furlonges of erthe an-
sweren to a degree of the firmament; and tho ben 87
miles and 4 furlonges. now be that here multiplyed
be 360 fithes; and than thei ben 31 500 myles, every
of 8 furlonges, aftre myles of oure contree. so moche
hathe the erthe in roundnesse, and of heghte enviroun,
aftre nyn opynyoun and myn undirstondynge. and
zee schulle undirstonde, that aftre the opynyoun of olde
wise philosophres and astronomeres, oure contree ne ire-
lond ne wales ne scotlond ne norweye ne the other yles
costynge to hem, ne ben not in the superficyalte cownted
aboven the erthe; as it schewethe be alle the bokes
of astronomye. for the superficialtee of the erthe is
departed in 7 parties, for the 7 planetes: and tho par-
ties ben clept clymates. and oure parties be not of
the 7 clymates: for thei ben descendynge toward the
west. and also these yles of ynde, which beth evene
azenst us, beth noght reckned in the climates: for thei
ben azenst us, that ben in the lowe contree. and the

the first of our authours, who can be properly said to
have written english, was sir jobn gower, who, in his
confession of a lover, calls chaucer his disciple, and may
therefore be considered as the father of our poetry.
ow e for to speke of the commune,
- it is to drede of that fortune,
which hath befalle in sondrye londes:
but ofte for defaute of bondes -
all sodeinly, er it be wift, r.' "
a tunne, whan his lie arist -
tobreketh, and renneth all aboute,
whiche els shulde nought gone out.
and eke full ofte a littell skare
vpon a banke, er men be ware,
let in the streme, whiche with gret peine,
if any man it shall restreine.
where lawe failleth, errour groweth.
he it not wise, who that ne troweth.
for it hath proued ofter this.
and thus the common clamour is
in euery londe, where people dwelleth:
and eche in his complainte telleth,
how that the worlde is miswent,
and thervpon his argument
yeueth euery man in sondrie wise:
but what man wolde him selfe auise
his conscience, and nought misuse,
he maie well at the first excuse
his god, whiche euer stant in one,
in him there is defaute none
so must it stande vpon vs selue,
nought only vpon ten ne twelue,
but plenarly vpon vs all.
for man is cause of that shall fall.
the history of our language is now brought to the
point at which the history of our poetry is generally sup-
posed to commence, the time of the illustrious geoffry
chaucer, who may perhaps, with great justice, be stiled
the first of our versifyers who wrote poetically. he
does not however appear to have deserved all the praise
which he has received, or all the censure that he has
suffered. dryden, who, mistaking genius for learning,
in confidence of his abilities, ventured to write of
what he had not examined, ascribes to chaucer the
first refinement of our numbers, the first production of
easy and natural rhymes, and the improvement of our
language, by words borrowed from the more polished
languages of the continent. skinner contrarily blames
him in harsh terms for having vitiated his native speech
by whole cartloads of foreign words. but he that reads
the works of gower will find smooth numbers and easy
rhymes, of which chaucer is supposed to have been the
inventor, and the french words, whether good or bad,

of which chaucer is charged as the importer. some
innovations he might probably make, like others, in the
jing of our poetry, which the paucity of books does
low is to discover with particular exactness; but the
works of gower and lydgate sufficiently evince, that his
jaion was in general like that of his contemporaries:
and some improvements he undoubtedly made by the
various dispositions of his rhymes, and by the mixture

las! i wepyng am constrained to begin verse of
a snowfull matter, that whilom in florishyng studie
made delitable ditees. for lo! rendyng muses of
portes enditen to me thinges to be writen, and drerie
tries. at laste no drede ne might overcame tho muses,
that theine werren fellowes, and foloweden my waie,
that is to shie, when i was exiled, thei that weren of
my youth whilom welfull and grene, comforten now
foowfull wierdes of me olde man : for elde is comen
unwirely upon me, hasted by the harmes that i have,
and sorowe hath commaunded his age to be in me.
hetes hose aren shad overtimeliche upon my hed: and
theslackeskinnetrembleth of mine empted bodie. thilke
deth of men is welefull, that he ne cometh not in yeres
that be swete, but cometh to wretches often icleped :
alas, als! with how defe an ere deth cruell turneth
awalefso wretches, and naieth for to close wepyng eyen.
whilefortune unfaithfull favoured me with light godes,
that sorowfull houre, that is to saie, the deth, had al-
most dense myne bedde: but now for fortune cloudie
hith chaunged her decevable chere to mewarde, myne
umpious life draweth along ungreable dwellynges. o
yemy fendes, what, or whereto avaunted ye me to
ton welfull? for he that hath fallin, stode in no stedfast
dogt,
ino mene while, that i still record these thynges
with my self, and marked my wepelie complainte with
office of poincell: i saugh stondyng aboven the hight
of myn hed a woman of full grete reverence, by sem-
blaunt. her eyenbrennyng, and clere, seyng over the
common might of menne, with a lively colour, and
with soche vigour and strength that it ne might not be
nempsed, all were it so, that she were full of so grewe
*go, that mennewoulden not trowen in no manere, that
she were of our elde. - -
the stature of her was of doutous judgemente, for
someyme she constrained and shronke her selven, like
to the common mesure of menne : and sometyme it
emed that she touched the beven with the hight of
to ledde, and when she hove her hedde higher, she
ported the self heven, so that the fight of menne lokyng
wis in ydell: ner clothes wer maked of right delie
too, and subtel craft of perdurable matter. the
miche dothes she had woven with her owne handes, as
iknows well after by her self declaryng, and shewyng
ome the beautie: the whiche clothes a darknesse of a
joikien and dispised elde had dusked and darked, as it

in the netherest hemme and border of these clothes

fixth the life active, and above that letter, in the biest

of different numbers, in which he seems to have been
happy and judicious. i have selected several specimens
both of his prose and verse; and among them, part of
his translation of boetius, to which, another version,
made in the time of queen mary, is opposed. . it would
be improper to quote very sparingly an author of so
much reputation, or to make very large extracts frosii
a
a book so generally known.

i that in tyme of prosperite, and floryshing studye,
made pleasaunte and delectable dities, or verses :
alas now beyng heauy and sad ouerthrowen in aduersitie,
am compelled to fele and tast heuines and greif. be-
holde the muses poeticall, that is to saye : the pleasure
that is in poetes verses, do appoynt me, and compel me
to writ these verses in meter, and the sorowfull verses do
wet my wretched face with very waterye teares, yssuinge
out of my eyes for sorowe. whiche muses no feare
without doute could ouercome, but that they wold folow
me in my iourney of exile or banishment. sometyme
the ioye of happy and lusty delectable youth dyd com-
fort me, and nowe the course of sorowfull olde age
causeth me to reioyse. for hasty old age vnloked for
is come vpon me with al her incommodities and euyls,
and sorow hath commaunded and broughte me into the
same old age, that is to say: that sorowe causeth me to
be olde, before my time come of olde age. the hoer
heares do growe vntimely vpon my heade, and my re-
uiled skynne trembleth my flesh, cleane consumed and
wasted with sorowe. mannes death is happy, that
cometh not in youth, when a man is lustye, and in plea-
sure or welth : but in time of aduersitie, when it is often
defyred. alas alas howe dull and deffe be the eares
of cruel death vnto men in misery that would fayne
dye : and yet refusythe to come and shutte vp theyr
carefull wepyng eyes. whiles that false fortune fa-
uoryd me with her transitorye goodes, then the howre
of death had almost ouercom me. that is to say deathe
was redy to oppresse me when i was in prosperitie. nowe
for by cause that fortune beynge turned, from prospe-
ritie into aduersitie (as the clere day is darkyd with
cloudes) and hath chaungya her deceyuable counte-
naunce : my wretched life is yet prolonged and doth
continue in dolour. , o my frendes why thaue you so
often bosted me, sayinge that i was happy when i had
honor possessions riches, and authoritie whych be tran-
sitory thynges. he that hath fallen was in no stedefast
degre. -
wh yles that i confiderydde pryuylye with my
selfe the thynges before sayd, and descrybed my
wofull complaynte, after the maner and offyce of a
wrytter, me thought i sawe a woman stand ouer my
head of a reuerend countenaunce, hauyng quycke and
gly steryng clere eyes, aboue the common sorte of men
in jyuely and delectable coloure, and ful of strength,
although she semed so olde that by no meanes she is
thought to be one of this oure tyme, her stature is of .
douteful knowledge, for nowe she shewethe herselfe at
the commen length or statur of men, and other whiles
she semeth so high, as though she touched heuen with
the crown of her hed. and when she wold stretch
fourth her hed hygher, it also perced thorough heauen,
so that mens syghte coulde not attaine to behold her.
her vestures or cloths were persyt of the finyste thredes,
and subtyll workemanshyp, and of substaunce perma.

as i perceyued after by her owne saiynge. the kynde
or beawtye of the whyche vestures, a certayne darkenes
or rather ignoraunce of oldenes forgotten hadde ob-
scuryd and darkened, as the smoke is wont to daken
images that stand nyghe the smoke. in the lower
parte of the said vestures was read the greke letter
p. wouen whych signifyeth praclise or actyse, and
in the hygher part of the vestures the greke letter t.
whych estandeth for theorica, that signifieth speculacion
or contemplation. and betwene both the sayd letters

everiche manne of 'hen had borne awaie soche peces,
as he might getten. and forsothe this foresaied woman
bare smale bokes in her right hande, and in her left
hand she bare a scepter. and when she sawe these poeti-
call muses approchyng about my bed, and endityng
wordes to my wepynges, she was a litle amoved, and
glowed with cruell eyen. who (q8 she) hath suffered
approchen to this fike manne these commen strompettes,
of which is the place that menne callen theatre, the
whiche onely ne asswagen not his sorowes with remedies,
but thei would feden and norishe hym with swete ve-
nime 2 forsothe, that ben tho that with thornes, and
prickynges of talentes of affeccions, whiche that ben
nothyng fructuous nor profitable, distroien the corne,
plentuous of fruictes of reson. for thei holden hertes
of men in usage, but thei ne deliver no folke fro ma-
ladie. but if ye muses had withdrawen fro me with
your flatteries any unconnyng and unprofitable manne,
as ben wont to finde commenly emong the peple, i would
well suffre the lasse grevously. for why, in soche an
unprofitable man myne ententes were nothyng enda-
maged. but ye withdrowen fro me this man, that hath
ben nourished in my studies or scoles of eleaticis, and
of academicis in grece. but goeth now rather awaie
ye mermaidens, whiche that ben swete, till it be at the
last, and suffreth this man to be cured and heled by
my muses, that is to say, by my notefull sciences. and
thus this companie of muses iblamed casten wrothly the
chere dounward to the yerth, and shewing by rednesse
ther shame, thei passeden sorowfully the thresholde. and
i of whom the sight plounged in teres was darked, so
that i ne might not know what that woman was, of so
imperial aucthoritie, i woxe all abashed and stonied, and
cast my fight doune to the yerth, and began still for to
abide what she would doen afterward. then came she
nere, and set her doune upon the utterest corner of my
bed, and she beholdyng my chere, that was cast to the
yerth, hevie and grevous of wepyng, complained with
these wordes (that i shall saine) the perturbacion of my
thought.
the conclusions of the astrolab ie.
this book (written to his son in the year of our lord
1391, and in the 14 of king richard ii.) standeth
so good at this day, especially for the horizon of ox-
ford, as in the opinion of the learned it cannot be
amended, says an edit. of chaucer.
y t e l lowys my sonne, i perceve well by cer-
taine evidences thyne abylyte to lerne scyences,
touching nombres and proporcions, and also well con-
sydre i thy besye prayer in especyal to lerne the tretyse
of the astrolabye. than for as moche as a philosopher
saithe, he wrapeth hym in his frende, that condiscendeth
to the ryghtfull prayers of his frende: therfore i have
given the a sufficient astrolabye for oure orizont, com-
powned after the latitude of oxenforde: upon the
whiche by mediacion of this lytell tretise, i purpose to
teche the a certaine nombre of conclusions, pertainynge
to this same instrument. i say a certaine nombre of
conclusions for thre causes, the first cause is this. truste
wel that al the conclusions that have be founden, or ells
possiblye might be founde in so noble an instrument as
in the astrolabye, ben unknowen perfitely to anye mor-
tal man in this region, as i suppose. another cause is
this, that sothely in any cartes of the astrolabye that i
have ysene, ther ben some conclusions, that wol not in al
thinges perfourme ther behestes: and some of 'hem ben
to harde to thy tender age of ten yere to conceve. this
tretise divided in five partes, wil i shewe the wondir light
rules and naked wordes in englishe, for latine ne canst
thou nat yet but smale, my litel sonne. but neverthe-
lesse suffiseth to the these trewe conclusyons in englishe,
as well as suffiseth to these noble clerkes grekes these
same conclusions in greke, and to the arabines in ara- .
bike, and to jewes in hebrewe, and to the latin folke
in latyn : whiche latyn folke had 'hem firste out of
other divers langages, and write 'hem in ther owne
tonge, that is to faine in latine. -
- - 2 - - - and
the hygher parte wher the letter t. was whych is vn.
derstand speculacion or contemplacion. neueitheles the
handes of some vyolente persones had cut the sayde ves-
tures and had taken awaye certayne pecis thereof, such
as euery one coulde catch. and she her selfe dyd bare
in her ryght hand litel bokes, and in her lefte hande a
scepter, which foresayd phylosophy (when she saw the
muses poetycal present at my bed, spekyng sorrowful
wordes to my wepynges) beyng angry sayd (with terri-
ble or frownynge countenaunce) who suffred these crafty
harlottes to coin to thys sycke man whych can help
hym by no means of hys griefe by any kind of medi-
cines, but rather increase the same with swete poyson.
these be they that doo dystroye the fertile and plen-
tious commodytyes of reason and the fruytes therof
wyth their pryckynge thornes, or barren affectes, and
accustome or subdue mens nyndes with sickenes, and
heuynes, and do not delyuer or heale them of the same.
but yf your flatterye had conueyed or wythdrawen from
me, any vniernyd man as the comen sorte of people
are wonte to be, i coulde haue ben better contentyd, for
in that my worke should not be hurt or hynderyd. but
you haue taken and conueyed from me thys m in that
hath ben broughte vp in the studyes of artiotel and of
plato. but yet get you hence maremaids (that seme swete
untyll you haue brought a man to deathe) and suffer me
to heale thys my man wyth my muses or scyences that
be holsome and good. and after that philolophy had
spoken these wordes the sayd companye of the musys
poeticall beynge rebukyd and sad, caste down their
countenaunce to the grounde, and by bluffyng confessed
their shamfastnes, and went out of the dores. but i
(that had my syght dull and blynd wyth wepyng, so
that i knew not what woman this was hauyng too great
aucthoritie) was amasyd or astonyed, and lokyng
downeward, towarde the grounde, i began pryvylye
to look what thyng she would siye ferther, then she
had said. then she approching and drawynge nere vnto
me, sat downe vpon the votermost part of my bed, and
lokyng vpon my face sad with weping, and declynyd
toward the earth for sorow, bewayled the trouble of my
minde wyth these sayinges folowynge.
and god wote that in all these languages and in
manye mo, have these conclusyons ben sufficientlye
lerned and taught, and yet by divers rules, right as di-
vers pathes leden divers folke the right waye to rome.
now wol i pray mekely every person discrete, that
redeth or hereth this lityl tretise to have my rude en-
tenting excused, and my superfluite of wordes, for two
causes. the first cause is, for that curious endityng
and harde sentences is ful hevy at ones, for soch a childe
to lerne. and the seconde cause is this, that sothely
me semeth better to writen unto a childe twise a gode
sentence, that he foriete it ones. and, lowis, if it be
so that i shewe the in my lith englishe, as trew conclu-
sions touching this mater, and not only as trewe but as
many and subtil conclusions as ben yshewed in latin, in
any comon tretise of the astrolabye, conne me the more
thanke, and praye god save the kinge, that is lorde of
this langage, and all that him faith beseth, and obeie h
everiche in his degree, the more and the lase. but con-
sydreth well, that i ne usurpe not to have founden this
werke of my labour or of myne engin. i n’ame but a
leude compilatour of the laboure of olde astrologiens,
and have it translated in myn englishe onely for thy doc-
trine: and with this swerde shal i slene envy. o
the first party.
the first partye of this tretise shall reherce the figures,
and the membres of thyne astrolaby, by cause that thou
shaite have the greter knowinge of thine owne instru-
iilci]t. o
the seconde party.
the seconde partye shal teche the to werken the very
practike of the foresaid conclusions, as fertorthe and also
narowe as may be shewed in so smale an instrument por-
tatise aboute. for wel wote every astrologien, that
smallest fractions ne wol not be shewed in so final an in-
strument, as in subtil tables calculed for a cause.

in southwerk at the tabberd as i lay,
redy to wendin on my pilgrimage

and shortly whan the sunne was to rest,

that i was of ther felaship anone;
and made forward erli for to rise,
to take our weye, ther as i did devise.
but nathless while that i have time and space,
er' that i farther in this tale pace,
methinkith it accordaunt to reson,
to tell you alle the condition
of ech of them, so as it semid me,
and which they werin, and of what degree,
and eke in what array that they wer in :

the knight.
a knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
that fro the time that he first began
to ridin out, he lovid chevalrie,
trouth and honour, fredome and curtesy.
full worthy was he in his lordis werre,
and thereto had he riddin nane more ferre
as well in christendom, as in hethness;
and evyr honoured for his worthiness.
at alessandre he was whan it was won 3
full oft timis he had the bord begon
abovin alle naciouns in pruce;
in lettow had he riddin, and in luce,
no christen-man so oft of his degree
in granada; in the sege had he be
of algezir, and ridd in belmary;
at leyis was he, and at sataly,
whan that they wer won; and in the grete see
at many'a noble army had he be:
at mortal battails had he ben fiftene,
and foughtin for our feith at tramesene,
in listis thrys, and alwey slein his fo.
this ilke worthy knight had ben also
sometimis with the lord of palathy,
ayens anothir hethin in turky ;
and evirmore he had a sov’rane prize;
and though that he was worthy, he was wise;
and of his port as meke as is a maid,
he nevir yet no villany ne said
in all his life unto no manner wight:
he was a very parfit gentil knight.
but for to tellin you of his array,
his hors wer good; but he was nothing gay,
of fustian he werid a gipon,
alle besmottrid with his haburgeon.
for he was late yeome from his viage,
and wente for to do his pilgrimage.

but as me slept me mette i was

and with perre mo pinnacles,
and mo curious portraituris,
and queint manir of figuris
of golde worke, then i sawe evir.
but certainly i noist nevir

it was of venus redily

and also on her hedde parde
her rosy garland white and redde,
and her combe for to kembe her hedde,

that in his face y-was full broune.
but as i romid up and doune,
i founde that on the wall there was
thus writtin on a table' of bras.

that first came through his destine
fugitife fro troye the countre
into itaile, with full moche pine,
unto the strondis of lavine,
and tho began the storie' anone,
as i shall tellin you echone.
first sawe i the distruccion
of troie, thorough the greke sinon,
with his false untrue forswerynges,
and with his chere and his lesynges,
that made a horse, brought into troye,
by whiche trojans loste all their joye.
and aftir this was graved, alas!
how ilions castill assailed was,
and won, and kyng priamus slains
and polites his sonne certain,
dispitously of dan pyrrhus.
and next that sawe i howe venus,
when that she sawe the castill brende,
doune from hevin she gan discende,
and bade her sonne aeneas fle,
and how he fled, and how that he
escapid was from all the pres,
and toke his fathre’, old anchises,
and bare hym on his backe awaie,
crying alas and welawaie
the whiche anchises in his hande,
bare tho the goddis of the lande
i mene thilke that unbrennid were.
then sawe i next that all in fere
how creusa, dan aeneas wife,
whom that he lovid all his life,
and her yong sonne clepid juio,
and eke ascanius also,
fleddin eke, with full drerie chere,
that it was pite for to here,
and in a forest as thei went
how at a tournyng of a went
creusa was ilofie, alas !
that rede not i, how that it was
how he her fought, and how her ghoste
bad hym to slie the grekis hoste,
and saied he must into itaile,
as was his destinie, sauns faile,
that it was pitie for to here,
when that her spirite gan appere,
the wordis that she to hym faied,
and for to kepe her sonne hym praed.
there sawe i gravin eke how he
i jis fathir eke, and his meine,
with his shippis began to saile
toward the countrey of itaile,
as streight as ere thei mightin go.

and of memorye the glasyng broteines,

with werines my spirite to assayle, -
and with their subtil creping in most queint

and ouermore, the ferefull frowardnes

whereas good wyll gan me constrayne,

came ignoraunce, with a menace of drede,
my penne to rest i durst not procede.
fortescue was chief justice of the common-pleas, in
the reign of king henry vi. he retired in 1471, after
the battle of tewkesbury, and probably wrote most of
his works in his privacy. the following passage is fe-
lected from his book of the difference between an also-
lute and limited monarchy.
hy t may peraventure be marvelid by some men,
why one realme is a lordshyp only royall, and the
prynce thereof rulyth yt by his law, callid jus kegale;
and another kyngdome is a lordschip, royal and poli-
tike, and the prince thereof rulyth by a lawe, callyd
jus politicum &amp; regale; sythen thes two princes beth
of egall astate.
to this dowte it may be answeryd in this manner;
the first institution of thes twoo realmys, upon the
incorporation of them, is the cause of this diversyte.
when nembroth by might, for his own glorye, made
and incorporate the first realme, and subduyd it to hym-
self by tyrannye, he would not have it governyd by any
other rule or lawe, but by his own will; by which
and for th’ accomplishment thereof he made it. and
therfor, though he had thus made a realme, holy scrip-
ture denyyd to cal hym a kyng, qoia rex dicitur a
regendo ; whych thyng he dyd not, but oppressyd the
people by myght, and therfor he was a tyrant, and
callid primus tyrannorum. but holy writ callith hym
robustus venator coram deo. for as the hunter takyth
the wyld beste for to scle and eate hym ; so nembroth
subduyd to him the people with might, to have their
service and their goods, using upon them the lordschip
that is callid dominium regale tantum. after hym be-
lus that was callid first a kyng, and after hym his sone
nynus, and after hym other panyms ; they, by exam-
ple of nembroth, made them realmys, would not have
them rulyd by other lawys than by their own wills.
which lawys ben right good under good princes;
and their kyngdoms a then most resemblyd to the kyng-
dome of god, which reynith upon man, rulyng him
by hys own will. wherfor many crystyn princes
usen the same lawe; and therfor it is, that the lawys
sayen, quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem. and
thus i suppose first beganne in realmys, dominium tam-
tum regale. but afterward, when mankynd was more
mansuete, and better disposyd to vertue, grete com-
munalties, as was the feliship, that came into this lond
with brute, wyllyng to be unyed and made a body po-
litike callid a realme, havyng an heed to governe it ;
as after the saying of the philosopher, every commu-
naltie unyed of many parts must needs have an heed;
than they chose the same brute to be their heed and
kyng. and they and he upon this incorporation and in-
stitution, and onyng of themself into a realme, ordeynyd
the same realme so to be rulyd and justyfyd by such
laws, as they al would assent unto; which law ther-
for is callid politicum ; and bycause it is mynystrid by a
kyng, it is callid regale. dominium politicum dicitur
quasi regimen, plurium scientia, sive consolio minisłratum.

lawe, videlicet, regimine politico &amp; regali. and as
diodorus syculus faith, in his boke de prisois historiis,
the realme of egypte is rulid by the same lawe, and
therfor the kyng therof chaungith not his lawes, with-
out the assent of his people. and in like forme as he
saith is ruled the kyngdome of saba, in felici arabia,
and the lond of libie ; and also the more parte of al
the realmys in afrike. which manner of rule and
lordship, the sayd diodorus in that boke, p, ayath grete-
ly. for it is not only good for the prince, that may
thereby the more sewerly do justice, than by his owne
arbitriment; but it is also good for his people that re-
ceyve therby, such justice as they defyer themself. now
as me seymth, it ys shewyd opinly ynough, why one
kyng rulyth and reynith on his people dominio tantum
regali, and that other reynith dominio politico &amp; regali:
for that one kyngdome beganne, of and by, the might
of the prince, and that other beganne, by the desier and
institution of the people of the same prince.
of the works of sir thomas more it was necessiry to
give a larger specimen, both because our language was
then in a great degree formed and settled, and because it
appears from benjohnson, that his works were considered
as models of pure and elegant style. the tale, which
is placed first, because earliest written, will show what an
attentive reader will, in perusing our old writers, often
remark, that the familiar and colloquial part of our lan-
guage, being diffused among those classes who had no
ambition of refinement, or affectation of novely, has
suffered very little change. there is another reason why
the extracts from this author are more copious : mis
works are carefully and correctly print d, and may there-
fore be better trusted than any other edition of the
english books of that, or the preceding ages.

that thriftly was,
or he coulde pas,
rapped about the pate,
whyle that he would
see how he could,
a little play the frere :
now yf you wyll,
knowe how it fyll,
take hede and ye shall here.
it happed so,
not long ago,
a thrifty man there dyed,
an hundred pounde,
of nobles rounde,
that had he layd a side:
his sonne he wolde,
should haue this golde,
for to beginne with all:
but to suffise
his chylde, well thrise,
that money was to smal.
yet or this day
i have hard say,
that many a man certese,
hath with good cast,
beryche at last,
that hath begonne with lesse.
but this yonge manne,
so well beganne,
his money to imploy,
that certainly,
his policy,
to see it was a joy,
for lest sum blast,
myght ouer cast,
his ship, or by mischaunce,
men with sum wile,
myght hym begyle,
and minish his substaunce,
for to put out,
al maner dout,
he made a good puruay,
for euery whyt,
by his owne wyt,
and toke an other way:
first fayre and wele,
therof much dele,
he dygged it in a pot,
but then him thought,
that way was nought,
and there he left it not.
so was he faine,
from thence agayne,
to put it in a cup,
and by and by,
couetously,
he supped it fayre vp,
in his owne brest,
he thought it best,
his money to enclose,
then wist he well,
what euer fell,
he coulde it neuer lose.
he borrowed then,
of other men,
money and marchaundise:
neuer payd it,
up he laid it,
in like maner wyse.
yet on the gere,
that he would were,
he reight not what he spent,
so it were nyce,
as for the price,
could him not miscontent.
with lusty sporte,
and with resort,
of ioly company,
in mirth and play,
full many a day,
he liued merely.
and men had sworne,
some man is borne,
to haue a lucky howre,
and so was he,
for such degre,
he gat and suche honour,
that without dout,
whan he went out,
a sergeaunt well and fayre,
was redy strayte,
on him to wayte,
as sone as on the mayre.
but he doubtlesse,
of his mekenesse,
hated such pompe and pride,
and would not go,
companied so,
but drewe himself a side,
to saint katharine,
streight as a line,
he gate him at a tyde,
for deuocion,
or promocion,
there would he nedes abyde,
there spent he fast,
till all were past,
and to him came there meny,
to aske theyr det,
but none could get,
the valour of a peny.
with visage stout, -
he bare it out,
euen vnto the harde hedge,
a month or twaine,
tyll he was faine,
to laye his gowne to pledge.
than was he there,
in greater feare,
than ere that he came thither,
and would as fayne,
depart againe,
but that he wist not whither.
than after this,
to a frende of his,
he went and there abode,
where as he lay,
so sick alway,
he myght not come abrode.
it happed than,
a marchant man,
that he ought money to,
cf an officere,
than gan enquere,
what him was best to do.
and he answerde,
be not aferde,
take an accion thersore,
i you beheste,
i shall hym reste,
and than care for no more.

i feare quod he,
it wyll not be,
for he wyll not come out.
the sergeaunt said,
be not afrayd,
it shall be brought about.
in many a game,
lyke to the same,
haue i bene well in vre,
and for your sake,
let me be bake,
but yf i do this cure.
thus part they both,
and foorth then goth,
a pace this officere,
and for a day,
all his array,
he chaunged with a frere,
so was he dight,
that no man might,
hym for a frere deny,
he dopped and dooked,
he spake and looked,
so religiously.
yet in a glasse,
or he would passe,
he toted and he peered,
his harte for pryde,
lepte in his syde,
to see how well he freered.
than forth a pace,
unto the place,
he goeth withouten shame
to do this dede,
but now take hede,
for here begynneth the game.
he drew hymny,
and softely,
streyght at the dore he knocked:
and a damsell,
that hard hym well,
there came and it vinlocked.
the frere sayd,
good spede fayre mayd,
here lodgeth such a man,
it is told me:
well syr quod she,
and yf he do what than.
quod he maystresse,
no harme doutlesse:
it longeth for our order,
to hurt no man,
but as we can,
euery wight to forder.
with hym truly,
fayne speake would i.
sir quod she by my fay,
he is so fike,
ye be not lyke,
to speake with hym to day.
quod he fayre may,
yet i you pray,
this much at my desire,
vouchesafe to do,
as go hym to,
and say an austen frere
would with hym speke,
and matters breake,
for his auayle certayn.
quod she i wyll,
stonde ye here styll,
tyll i come downe agayn.
vp is the go,
and told hym so,
as she was bode to say,
he mistrustying,
no maner thyng,
sayd mayden go thy way,
and fetch him hyder,
that we togyder,
may talk. a downe she gothe,
vp she hym brought,
no harme she thought,
but it made some folke wrothe.
this officere,
this fayned frere,
whan he was come aloft,
he dopped than,
and grete this man,
religiously and oft.
and he agayn,
ryght glad and fayn,
toke hym there by the hande,
the frere than sayd,
ye be dismayd,
with trouble i understande.
in dede quod he,
it hath with me,
bene better than it is.
syr quod the frere,
be of good chere,
yet shall it after this.
but i would now,
comen with you,
in counsayle yf you please,
or elly's nat
of matters that,
shall set your heart at ease.
downe went the mayd,
the marchaunt sayd,
now say on gentle frere,
of thys tydyng,
that ye me bryng,
i long full fore to here.
whan there was none,
but they alone,
the frere with euyll grace,
sayd, i rest the,
come on with me,
and out he toke his mace:
thou shalt obay,
come on thy way,
i have the in my clouche,
thou goest not hence,
for all the pense,
the mayre hath in his pouche;
this marchaunt there,
for wrath and sere,
i he waxyng welnygh wood,
sayd horson these,
with a mischefe,
who hath taught the thy good,
and with his fist,
vpon the lyst,
he gaue hym such a blow,
that backward downe,
almost in sowne,
the frere is ouerthrow.
yet was this man,
well fearder than,
lest he the frere had slayne,
tyll with good rappes,
and heuy clappes,
he dawde hym vp agayne.
the frere toke harte,
and vp he starte,
and well he layde about,
and so there goth,
betwene them both,
many a lusty clout.
they rent and tere,
eche others here,
and claue togyder fast,
tyll with luggyng,
and with tuggyng,
they fell downe bothe at last.
than on the grounde,
togyder rounde,
with many a sadde stroke,
they roll and rumble,
they turne and tumble,
as pygges do in a poke.

so long aboue,
they heue and shoue,
togider that at last,
the mayd and wyfe,
to breake the strife,
hyed them vpward fast.
and whan they spye,
the captaynes lye,
both waltring on the place,
the freres hood,
they pulled a good,
adowne about his face.
whyle he was blynde,
the wenche behynde,
lent him leyd on the flore,
many a ioule,
about the noule,
with a great batyldore.
the wyfe came yet,
and with her fete,
. she holpe to kepe him downe,
and with her rocke,
many a knocke,
she gaue hym on the crowne.
they layd his mace,
about his face,
that he was wood for payne:
the fryre frappe,
gate many a swappe,
tyll he was full nygh slayne.
vp they hym lift,
and with yll thrift,
hedlyng a long the stayre,
towne they hym threwe,
and sayde adewe,
commende us to the mayre.
the frere arose,
but i suppose,
annated was his hed,
he shoi.e his cares,
and from grete feares,
he thought hym well ysled.
quod he now lost, -
is all this cost,
we be neuer the nere.

without my fauour there is nothyng wonne.
many a matter haue i brought at last,
to good conclusion, that fondly was begonne.
and many a purpose, bounden sure and fast
with wise prouilion, i haue ouercast.
without good happe there may no wit suffise.
better is to be fortunate than wyse.
and therefore hath there some men bene or this,
my deadly foes and written many a boke,
to my disprayse. and other cause there nys,
but for me list not frendly on them loke.
thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke,
the pleasaunt grapes, and gan for to defy them,
because he lept and yet could not come by them.
but let them write theyr labour is in vayne.
for well ye wote, myrth, honour, and richesse,
much better is than penury and payne.
the nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse,
without myne helpe is euer comfortlesse,
a wery burden odious and loth,

but he that by my fauour may ascende,
to mighty power and excellent degree,
a common wele to gouerne and defende,
o in how blist condicion standeth he .
him self in honour and felicite,
and ouer that, may forther and increase,
a region hole in oyfull rest and peace.
now in this poynt there is no more to say,
eche man hath of him self the gouernaunce.
let euery wight than folowe his owne way,
and he that out of pouettee and mischaunce,
list for to liue, and wyll him selfe enhaunce,
in wealth and richeste, come forth and wayte on me.
and he that wyll be a beggar, let hym be.
thomas mor e to them that trust in fortune.
hou that are prowde of honour, shape or kynne,
that hepest vp this wretched worides treasure,
thy fingers shrined with gold, thy tawny skynne,
with fresh apparyle garnished out of measure,
and wenest to haue fortune at thy pleasure,
cast vp thyne eye, and loke how slipper chaunce,
illudeth her men with chaunge and varyaunce.
sometyme she loketh as louely, fayre and bright,
as goodly uenus mother of cupyde.
she becketh and she smileth on euery wight.
but this chere fayned, may not long abide.
there cometh a cloude, and farewell all our pryde.
like any scrpent she beginneth to swell,
and looke has fierce as any fury of hell.
yet for ail that we brotle men are fayne,
(so wretched is our nature and so blynde)
as soone as fortune list to laugh agayne,
with fayre countenaunce and disceitfull mynde,
to crouche and knele and gape after the wynde,
not one or twayne but thousandes in a rout,
lyke swarmyng bees come flickery ng her aboute.
then as a bayte she tryngeth forth her ware,
siluer, gold, riche perle, and precious stone :
on whiche the mased people gase and stare,
and gape therefore, as dogges doe for the bone.
fortune at them laugheth, and in her trone
amyd her treasure and waueryng rychesse,
prowdly she houeth as lady and empresse.
fast by her syde doth wery labour stand,
pale fere also, and sorow all bewept,
disdayn and hatred on that other hand,
eke restles watche fro slepe with trauayle kept,
his eyes drowsy and lokyng as he slept.
before her standeth daunger and enuy,
flattery, dysceyt, mischiefe and tiranny.
about her commeth all the world to begge.
he asketh lande, and he to pas would bryng,
this toye and that, and all not worth an egge:
he would in loue prosper aboue all thyng:
he kneleth downe and would be made a kyng:
he forceth not so he may money haue,
though all the worlde accompt hym for a knaue.
lo thus ye see diuers heddes, diuers wittes.
fortune alone as diuers as they all,
vnstable here and there among them flittes :
and at auenture downe her giftes fall,
catch who so may she throweth great and small
not to all men, as commeth sonne or dewe,
but for the most part, all among a fewe.
and yet her brotell giftes long may not last.
he that she gaue them, loketh prowde and hye.
she whirlth about and pluckth away as fast,
and geueth them to an other by and by.
and thus from man to man continually,
she vseth to geue and take, and slily tosse,
one man to wynnyng of an others losse.
and when she robbeth one, down goth his pryde.
he wepeth and wayleth and curfeth her full sore.
but he that receueth it, on that other syde,
is glad, and blesth her often tymes therefore.
but in a whyle when she loueth hym no more,
she glydeth from hym, and her giftes to,
and he her curfeth, as other fooles do.
alas the folysh people can not cease,
ne voyd her trayne, tyil they the harme do fele. |
about her alway, besely they preace. |
but lord how he doth thynk hym self full wele.
that may set once his hande vppon her whele.
he holdeth fast : but vpward as he flieth,
she whippeth her whele about, and there he lyeth.
thus fell julius from his mighty power.
thus fell darius the worthy kyng of perse. |
thus fell alexander the great conquerour.
thus many mothen i may well reherse. -
thus double fortune, when she lyst reuerse
her slipper fauour fro them that in her trust,
she fleeth her wey and leyeth them in the dust.
she sode inly enhaunceth them aloft.
and sodeynly mischeueth all the flocke.
the head that late lay easily and full soft,
in slede of pylows lyeth after on the blocke.
and yet alas the most cruell proude mocke:
the deynty mowth that ladyes kissed haue,
she bryngeth in the case to kysse a knaue.
in chaungyng of her course, the chaunge she wth this,
vp startth a knaue, and downe there falth a knight.
the beggar ryche, and the ryche man pore is.
hatred is turned to loue, loue to despyght.
this is her sport, thus proueth she her myght.
great botte‘she maketh yf one be by her power,
welthy and wretched both within an howre.
pouertee that of her gif.es wyl nothing take,
wyth mery chere, looketh vppon the prece,
and sceth how fortunes houshold gocth to wake.
fast by her standeth the wyse socrates.

bekyth hym poore diogenes in his tonne.

that eche man hastely gan to cary thence,
and asked hym why he nought caryed out.

for nought he counted his that he might leese.

with glad pouertee, democritus also:
of which the fyrst can neuer cease but wepe,
to see how thick the blynded people go,
with labour great to purchase care and wo.
that other laugheth to see the foolysh apes,
howe earnestly they walk about theyr capes. -
of this poore sect, it is comen vsage,
onely to take that nature may sustayne,
banishing cleane all other surplusage,
they be content, and of nothyng complayne,
no nygarde eke is of his good so fayne.
but they more pleasure haue a thousande folde,
the secrete draughtes of nature to beholde.

that one is frce, that other euer thrall,
that one content, that other neuer full.

nowe haue i shewed you bothe: these whiche ye lyst,
stately fortune, or humble pouertee:
that is to say, nowe lyeth it in your fyst,
to take here bondage, or free libertee.
but in thys poynte and ye do after me,
draw you to fortune, and labour her to please,
if that yethynke your selfe to well at ease.
and fyrst vppon the louely shall she smile,
and frendly on the cast her wandering eyes,
embrace the in her armes, and for a whyle,
put the and kepe the in a fooles paradise:
and foorth with all what so thou lyst deuise,
she wyll the graunt it liberally parhappes:
but for all that beware of after clappes.
recken you neuer of her fauoure sure:
ye may in clowds as easily trace an hare,
or in drye lande cause fishes to endure,
and make the burnyng fyre his heate to spare,
and all thys worlde in compace to forfare,
as her to make by craft or engine stable,
that of her nature is euer variable.
serue her day and nyght as reuerently,
vppon thy knees as any seruaunt may,
and in conclusion, that thou shalt winne thereby
shall not be worth thy servyce i dare say.
and looke yet what she geueth the to day,
with labour wonne she shall happly to morow
i'luck it agayne out of thyne hande with sorow.
wherefore yf thou in suretye lyst to stande,
take pouerties parte and let prowde fortune go,
receyue nothyng that commeth from her hande.
loue maner and vertue: they be onely tho.
whiche double fortune may not take the fro.
then mayst thou boldly defye her turnyng chaunce:
she can the neyther hynder nor auaunce.
but and thou wylt nedes medle with her treasure,
trust not therein, and spende it liberally.
beare the not proude, nor take not out of measure.
bylde not thyne house on heyth vp in the skye.
none falleth farre, but he that climbeth hye,
remember nature sent the hyther bare,
the gyftes of fortune count them borowed ware.
thom as more to them that seke fortune.
whq so delyteth to prouen and assay,
- of waveryng fortune the vncertayne lot,
if that the aunswere please you not alway,
blame ye not me: for i commaunde you not,
fortune to trust, and eke full well ye wot,
i haue of her no brydle in my fist,
she renneth loose, and turneth where she lyst.
the rollyng dyse in whome your lucke doth stande,
with whose vnhappy chaunce ye be so wroth,
ye knowe your selfe came neuer in myne hande.
lo in this ponde be fy she and frogges both.
cast in your nette: but be you liese or lothe,
hold you content as fortune lyst asyne:
for it is your owne fishyng and not myne.
and though in one chaunce fortune you offend,
grudge not there at, but beare a mery face.
in many an other she shall it amende.
there is no manne so farre out of her grace,
but he sometyme hath comfort and solace:
ne none agayne so farre foorth in her fauour,
that is full satisfyed with her behauiour.
fortune is stately, solemne, prowde, and hye:
and rychefse goueth, to haue seruyce therefore.
the nedy begger catcheth an halfpeny:
some manne a thousande pounde, some lesse some more.
but for all that she kepeth euer in store,
from euery manne some parcell of his wyll,
that he may pray therfore and serue her styll.
some manne hath good, but chyldren hath he none.
some man hath both, but he can get none health.
some hath al thre, but vp to honours trone,
can he not crepe, by no maner of stelth.
to some she sendeth, children, ryches, welthe,
honour, woorshyp, and reuerence all bys life:
but yet she pyncheth hym with a shrewde wyse.
then for afmuch as it is fortunes guyse,
to graunt no manne all thyng that he wyll axe,
but as her selfe lyst order and deuyse,
doth euery manne his parte diuide and tax,
i counsayle you eche one trusse vp your packes,
and take no thyng at all, or be content,
with suche rewarde as fortune hath you sent.
all thynges in this boke that ye shall rede,
doe as ye lyst, there shall no manne you bynde,
them to beleue, as surely as your crede.
but notwithstandyng certes in my mynde,
i durst well swere, as true ye shall them fynde,
in euery poynt eche answere by and by,
as are the iudgementes of astronomye.

in other menne otherwise, he was malicious, wrathfull,
enuious, and from afore his birth, euer frowarde. it is
for trouth reported, that the duches his mother had so
much a doe in her trauaile, that shee coulde not bee de-
liuered of hym vncutte: and that hee came into the
worlde with the feete forwarde, as menne bee borne out-
warde, and (as the fame runneth) also not vntothed,
whither menne of hatred reporte aboue the trouthe, or
elles that nature chaunged her course in hys beginninge,
whiche in the course of his lyfe many thinges vnnatu-
rallye committed. none euill captaine was hee in the
warre, as to whiche his disposicion was more metely then
for peace. sundrye victories hadde hee, and somme-
time ouerthrowes, but neuer in defaulte as for his owne
parsone, either of hardinesse or polytike order, free was
hee called of dyspence, and sommewhat aboue hys
power liberall, with large giftes hee get him vnstedfaste
frendeshippe, for whiche hee was fain to pil and spoyle
in other places, and get him stedfast hatred. hee was
close and secrete, a deepe dissimuler, lowlye of countey-
naunce, arrogant of heart, outwardly coumpinable
where he inwardely hated, not letting to kisse whome
hee thoughte to kyll : dispitious and cruell, not for euill
will alway, but after for ambicion, and either for the
suretie or encrease of his estate. frende and foo was
muche what indifferent, where his aduauntage grew, he
spared no mans deathe, whose life withstoode his pur-
pose. he slewe with his owne handes king henry the
sixt, being prisoner in the tower, as menne constantly
saye, and that without commaundement or knoweledge
of the king, whiche woulde vndoubtedly yf he had en-
tended that thinge, haue appointed that boocherly of.
fice, to some other then his owne borne brother.
somme wise menne also weene, that his drift couertly
conuayde, lacked not in helping furth his brother of
clarence to his death: whiche hee resisted openly, how-
beit somwhat (as menne deme) more faintly then he
that wer hartely minded to his welth. and they that
thus deme, think that he long time in king edwardes
life, forethought to be king in that case the king his
brother (whose life hee looked that euill dyete shoulde
shorten) shoulde happen to decease (as in dede he did)
while his children wer yonge. and thei deme, that
for thys intente he was gladde of his brothers death the
duke of clarence, whose life must nedes haue hindered
hym so entendynge, whither the same duke of clarence
hadde kepte him true to his nephew the yonge king, or
enterprised to be kyng himselfe. but of al this pointe,
is there no certaintie, and whoso diuineth vppon con-
iectures, maye as wel shote to farre as to short. how
beit this haue i by credible informacion learned, that
the selfe nighte in whiche kynge edwarde died, one
mystlebrooke longe ere mornynge, came in greate haste
to the house of one pottyer dwellyng in reddecrosse
strete without crepulgate: and when he was with hastye
rappyng quickly letten in, hee shewed vnto pottyer that
kynge edwarde was departed. by my trouthe manne
quod pottier then wyll my may ster the duke of glou-

to speake it of noughte.
but nowe to returne to the course of this hystorye,
were it that the duke of gloucester hadde of old fore-
minded this conclusion, or was nowe at erste thereunto
moued, and putte in hope by the occasion of the tender
age of the younge princes, his nephues (as opportu-
nitye and lykelyhoode of spede, putteth a manne in
courage of that hee neuer entended) certayn is it that
hee contriued theyr destruccion, with the vsurpacion of
the regal dignitye vppon hymselfe. and for as muche
as hee well wiste and holpe to mayntayn, a long continued
grudge and hearte brennynge betwene the quenes kinred
and the kinges blood eyther partye enuying others au-
thoritye, he nowe thought that their deuision shoulde
bee (as it was in dede) a fortherlye begynnynge to the
pursuite of his intente, and a sure ground for the foun-
dacion of al his building yf he might firste vnder the
pretext of reuengynge of olde displeasure, abuse the
anger and ygnoraunce of the tone partie, to the destruc-
cion of the tother: and then wynne to his purpose as
manye as he coulde: and those that coulde not be
wonne, myght be loste ere they looked therefore. for
of one thynge was hee certayne, that if his entente were
perceiued, he shold soone haue made peace beetwene the
bothe parties, with his owne bloude.
kynge edwarde in his life, albeit that this discencion
beetwene hys frendes sommewhat yrked hym: yet in his
good health he sommewhat the lesse regarded it, because
hee thought whatsoeuer busines shoulde falle betwene
them, hymselfe should alwaye bee hable to rule bothe
the parties.
but in his last sicknesse, when hee receiued his naturall
strengthe soo fore enfebled, that hee dyspayred all re-
couerye, then hee consyderynge the youthe of his chyl-
dren, albeit hee nothynge lesse mistrusted then that that
happened, yet well forseynge that manye harmes myghte
growe by theyr debate, whyle the youth of hys children
shoulde lacke discrecion of themself and good counsayle
of their frendes, of whiche either party shold counsayle
for their owne commodity and rather by pleasaunte ad-
uyse too wynne themselfe fauour, then by profitable ad-
uertisemente to do the children good, he called some of
them before him that were at variaunce, and in especyall
the lorde marques dorsette the quenes sonne by her
fyrste housebande, and richarde the lorde hastynges,
a noble man, than lorde chaumberlayne agayne whome
the quene specially grudged, for the great fauoure the
kyng bare hym, and also for that shee thoughte hym se-
cretely familyer with the kynge in wanton coumpanye.
her kynred also bare hym fore, as well for that the
kynge hadde made hym captayne of calyce (whiche office
the lorde ryuers, brother to the quene, claimed of the
kinges former promyse as for diuerse other great giftes
which hee receyued, that they loked for. when these
lordes with diuerse other of bothe the parties were comme
in presence, the kynge liftinge vppe himselfe and vnder-
sette with pillowes, as it is reported on this wyse sayd
wnto them, my lordes, my dere kinsmenne and alies,
in what plighte i lye you see, and i feele. by whiche the
lesse whyle i looke to lyue with you, the more depelye
am i moued to care in what case i leaue you, for such
as i leaue you, suche bee my children lyke to fynde you.
whiche if they shoulde (that godde forbydde) fynde
you at varyaunce, myght happe to fall themselfe at warre
ere their discrecion woulde serue to sette you at peace.
ye se their youthe, of whiche i recken the onely suretie
to reste in youre concord. for it suffiseth not that al
you loue them, yf eche of you hate other. if they wer
menne, your faithfulnesse happelye woulde suffise. but
childehood must be maintained by mens authoritye, and
flipper youth vnderpropped with elder counsayle, which
neither they can haue, but ye geue it, nor ye geue it,
yf ye gree not. for wher eche laboureth to breake that
the other maketh, and for hatred of ech of others par-
son, impugneth eche others counsayle, there must it
nedes bee long ere anye good conclusion goe forwarde.
and also while either partye laboureth to be chiefe,
flattery shall haue more place then plaine and faithfull
aduyse, of whyche muste needes ensue the euyll bring-
ing vpp'e of the prynce, whose mynd in tender youth
infect, shal redily fal to mischief and riot, and drawe
down with this noble realme to ruine, but if grace turn
him to wisdom: which if god send, then thei that by
euill menes before pleased him best, shal after fall farthest
out of fauour, so that euer at length euil driftes dreue
to nought, and good plain wayes prosper. great va-
riaunce hath ther long bene betwene you, not alway for
great causes. sometime a thing right wel intended,
our misconstruccion turneth vnto worse or a final dis-
pleasure done vs, eyther our owne affeccion or euil
tongues agreueth. but this wote i well ye neuer had so
great cause of hatred, as ye haue of loue. that we be
al men, that we be christen men, this shall i leaue for
prechers to tel you (and yet i wote nere whither any
preachers wordes ought more to moue you, then his
that is by and by gooying to the place that thei all
preache of.) but this shal i desire you to remember,
that the one parte of you is of my bloode, the other of
myne alies, and eche of yow with other, eyther of kin-
red or affinitie, whiche spirytuall kynred of affynyty, if
the sacramentes of christes churche, beare that weyghte
with vs that woulde godde thei did, shoulde no lesse
moue vs to charitye, then the respecte of fleshlye con-
sanguinitye. oure lorde forbydde, that you loueto-
gether the worse, for the selfe cause that you ought to
loue the better. and yet that happeneth. and no
where fynde wee so deadlye debate, as amonge them,
whyche by nature and lawe moste oughte to agree toge-
ther. suche a pestilente serpente is ambicion and defyre
of vaine glorye and soueraintye, whiche amonge states
where he once entreth crepeth foorth so farre, tyll with
deuision and variaunce hee turneth all to mischiefe.
firste longing to be nexte the best, afterwarde egall
with the beste, and at laste chiefe and aboue the bette.
of which immoderate appetite of woorship, and thereby
of debate and diffencion what losse, what sorowe, what
trouble hathe within these fewe yeares growen in this
realme, i praye godde as well forgeate as wee well re-
member.
whiche thinges yf i coulde as well haue foresene, as
i haue with my more payne then pleasure proued, by
goddes blessed ladie (that was euer his othe) i woulde
neuer haue won the courtesye of mennes knees, with
the losse of foo many heades. but sithen thynges passed
cannot be gaine called, muche oughte wee the more be-
ware, by what occasion we haue taken soo greate hurte
afore, that we eftesoones fall not in that occasion agayne.
nowe be those griefes passed, and all is (godde be
thanked) quiete, and likelie righte wel to prosper in
wealthfull peace vnder youre coseyns my children, if
godde sende them life and you loue. of whyche twoo
thinges, the lesse losse wer they by whome thoughe
godde dydde hys pleasure, yet shoulde the realme al-
way finde kinges and paraduenture as good kinges. but
yf you among youre selfe in a childes reygne fall at de-
bate, many a good man shall perish and happely he to,
and ye to, ere thys land finde peace again. wherfore
in these last wordes that euer i looke to speak with you :
i exhort you and require you al, for the loue that you
haue euer borne to me, for the loue that i haue euer
born to you, for the loue that our lord beareth to vs
all, from this time forwarde, all grieues forgotten, eche
of you loue other. whiche i verelye truste you will,
if ye any thing earthly regard, either godde or your
king, affinitie or kinred, this realme, your owne coun-
trey, or your owne surety. and therewithal the king
no longer enduring to sitte vp, laide him down on his
right side, his face towarde them : and none was there
present that coulde refrain from weping. but the lordes
recomforting him with as good wordes as they could,
and answering for the time as thei thought to stand with
his pleasure, there in his presence (as by their wordes
appered) ech forgaue other, and ioyned their hands to-
gether, when (as it after appeared by their dedes) their
hearts wer far a sonder. as fone as the king was de-
parted, the noble prince his sonne drew toward london,
which at the time of his decease, kept his houshold at
ludlow in wales. which countrey being far of from
the law and recourse to iustice, was begon to be farre
oute of good wyll and waxen wild, robbers and riuers
walking at libertie vncorrected. and for this o

the prince was in the life of his father sente thither, to
the end that the authoritie of his presence, should re-
fraine euill disposed parsons fro the boldnes of their
former outerages, to the gouernaunce and ordering of
this yong prince at his sending thyther, was there ap-
pointed sir antony wodule lord riuers and brother
wnto the quene, a right honourable man, as valiaunte
of hande as politike in counsayle. adioyned wer there
vnto him other of the same partie, and in effect euery
one as he was nerest of kin vnto the quene, so was
planted next about the prince. that drifte by the quene
not vnwisely deuised, whereby her bloode mighte of
youth be rooted in the princes fauor, the duke of glou-
cester turned vnto their destruccion, and vpon that
grounde set the foundacion of all his vinhappy building.
for whom soeuer he perceiued, either at variance with
them, or bearing himself their fauor, hee brake vnto
them, some by mouth, som by writing and secret mes.
fengers, that it neyther was reason nor in any wise to be
suffered, that the yong king their master and kinsmanne,
shoo!d bee in the handes and custodye of his mothers
kinred, sequestred in maner from theyr compani and at-
tendance, of which eueri one ought him as faithful ser-
uice as they, and manye of them far more honorable
part of kin then his mothers fide: whose blood (quod
he) sauing the kinges pleasure, was ful vinmetely to be
matched with his ; whiche nowe to be as who say re-
moued from the kyng, and the lesse noble to be left
aboute him, is (quod he] neither honorable to hys ma-
gettie, nor vnto vs, and also to his grace no surety to
haue the mightiest of his frendes from him, and vnto
vs no little iedpardy, to susfer our welproued euil willers,
to grow in ouergret authoritie with the prince in youth,
namely which is lighte of beliefe and fone perswaded.
ye remember i trow king edward himself, albeit he
was a manne of age and of discrecion, yet was he in
manye thynges ruled by the bende, more then stode
either with his honour, or our profite, or with the com-
moditie of any manne els, except onely the immoderate
aduauncement of them selfe. whiche whither they
forer thirsted after their owne weale, or our woe, it wer
hard i wene to gesse. and if some folkes frendship had
not holden better place with the king, then any respect
of kinred, thei might peraduenture easily haue be
trapped and brought to confusion somme of vs ere this.
why not as easily as they haue done some other al-
readye, as neere of his royal bloode as we. but our
lord hath wrought his wil, and thanke be to his grace
that peril is patte. howe be it as great is growing,
yf wee suffer this yonge kyng in oure enemyes hande,
whiche without his wyttyng, might abuse the name of
his commaundement, to ani of our vndoing, which
thyng god and good prouision forbyd. of which good
proulsion none of us hath any thing the lesse nede, for
the late made attonemente, in whiche the kinges plea-
sure hadde more place then the parties willes. nor none
of vs i beleue is so vnwyse, ouersone to truste a newe
frende made of an olde foe, or to think that an houerly
kindnes, sodainely contract in one houre continued, yet
scant a fortnight, shold be deper setled in their sto-
mackes: then a long accustomed malice many yeres
rooted.
with these wordes and writynges and suche other,
the duke of gloucester sone set a fyre, them that were
of themself ethe to kindle, and in especiall twayne,
edwarde duke of buckingham, and richarde lorde
hastinges and chaumberlayn, both men of honour and
of great power. the tone by longe succession from his
ancestrie, the tother by his office and the kinges fauor.
these two not bearing eche to other so muche loue, as
hatred bothe vnto the quenes parte : in this poynte ac-
corded together wyth the duke of gloucester, that they
wolde voterlye amoue fro the kynges companye, all his
mothers frendes, vnder the name of their enemyes.
vpon this concluded, the duke of gloucester vnder-
standyng, that the lordes whiche at that tyme were
aboute the kyng, entended to bryng him vppe to his
coronacion, accoumpanied with suche power of theyr
frendes, that it shouldebee harde for hym to brynge his
purpose to passe, without the gathering and great as-
femble of people and in maner of open warre, whereof
the ende he wiste was doubtuous, and in which the kyng
being on their side, his part should haue the face and
name of a rebellion: he secretly therefore by dieers
meanes, caused the quene to be perswaded and brought
in the mynd, that it neither wer nede, and also shold be
icopardous, the king to come vp strong. for where as
nowe euery lorde loued other, and none other thing
studyed vppon, but aboute the coronacion and honoure
of the king : if the lordes of her kinred shold assemble
in the kinges name muche people, thei should geue the
lordes atwixte whome and them hadde bene sommetyme
debate, to feare and suspecte, leste they shoulde gather
thys people, not for the kynges sauegarde whome no
manne empugned, but for theyr destruccion, hauying
more regarde to their olde variaunce, then their newe
attonement. for whiche cause thei shoulde assemble on
the other partie muche people agayne for their defence,
whose power she wyste wel farre stretched. and thus
should all the realme fall on a rore. and of al the
hurte that therof should ensue, which was likely not to
be litle, and the most harme there like to fal wher she
left would, all the worlde woulde put her and her kin-
red in the wyght, and say that thei had vnwyselye and
wntrewlye also, broken the amitie and peace that the
kyng her husband so prudentelye made, betwene hys
kinne and hers in his death bed, and whiche the other
party faithfully obserued.
the quene being in this wise perswaded, suche woorde
sente vnto her sonne, and vnto her brother being aboute
the kynge, and ouer that the duke of gloucester hym-
selfe and other lordes the chiefe of hys bende, wrote
vnto the kynge soo reuerentelye, and to the queenes
frendes, there soo louyngelye, that they nothynge earthe-
lye mystrustynge, broughre the kynge vppe in greate
haste, not in good spede, with a sober coumpanye.
nowe was the king in his waye to london gone, from
northampton, when these dukes of gloucester and
buckyngham came thither. where remained behynd,
the lorde ryuers the kynges vncle, entendyng on the
morowe to folow the kynge, and bee with hym at stonye
stratford miles thence, earely or hee departed.
so was there made that nyghte muche frendely chere
betwene these dukes and the lord riuers a greate while.
but incontinente after that they were oppenlye with
greate courtesye departed, and the lorde riuers lodged,
the dukes secretelye with a fewe of their moste priuye
frendes, sette them downe in counsayle, wherin they
spent a great parte of the nyght. and at their risinge
in the dawnyng of the day, thei sent about priuily to
their seruantes in their innes and lodgynges about, ge-
uinge them commaundemente to make themselfe shorte-
ly readye, for their lordes wer to horsebackward. vp-
pon whiche messages, manye of their folke were atten-
daunt, when manye of the lorde riuers seruantes were
wnreadye. nowe hadde these dukes taken also into their
custodye the kayes of the inne, that none shoulde passe
foorth without theyr licence.
and ouer this in the hyghe waye towarde stonye
stratforde where the kynge laye, they hadde beestowed
certayne of theyr folke, that shoulde send backe agayne,
and compell to retourne, anye manne that were gotten
oute of northampton toward stonye stratforde, tyll
they should geue other lycence. for as muche as the
dukes themselfe entended for the shewe of theire dyly-
gence, to bee the fyrste that shoulde that daye attende
vppon the kynges highnesse oute of that towne : thus
bare they folke in hande. but when the lorde ryuers
vnderstode the gates closed, and the wayes on euerye
side besette, neyther hys seruauntes nor hymself suffered
to go oute, parceiuyng well so greate a thyng without
his knowledge not begun for noughte, comparyng this
maner present with this last nightes chere, in so few
houres so gret a chaunge marueylouslye misliked. how
be it sithe hee coulde not geat awaye, and keepe him-
selfe close, hee woulde not, leste he shoulde seeme to
hyde himselfe for some secret feare of hys owne faulte,
whereof he saw no such cause in hym self: he determined
vppon the suretie of his own conscience, to goe boldelye
to them, and inquire what thys matter myghte meant-
whome as soone as they sawe, they beganne to quarrell
with hym, and saye, that hee intended to sette distaunce
beetween:

o
beetweene the kynge and them, and to brynge them to
confusion, but it shoulde not lye in hys power. and
when hee beganne (as hee was a very well spoken manne)
in goodly wise to excuse himself, they taryed not the
ende of his aunswere, but shortely tooke him and putte
him in warde, and that done, foorthwyth wente to
horsebacke, and tooke the waye to stonye stratforde.
where they founde the kinge with his companie readye
to leape on horsebacke, and departe forwarde, to leave
that lodging for them, because it was to streighte for
bothe coumpanies. and as sone as they came in his
presence, they lighte adowne with all their companie
aboute them. to whome the duke of buckingham
saide, goe afore gentlemenne and yeomen, kepe youre
rowmes. and thus in goodly arraye, thei came to the
kinge, and on theire knees in very humble wife, salued
his grace; whiche receyued them in very ioyous and
amiable maner, nothinge earthlye knowing nor mistrust-
inge as yet. but euen by and by in his presence, they
piked a quarell to the lorde richard graye, the kynges
other brother by his mother, sayinge that hee with the
lorde marques his brother and the lorde riuers his vncle,
hadde coumpassed to rule the kinge and the realme, and
to sette variaunce among the states, and to subdewe and
destroye the noble blood of the realm. toward the ac-
coumplishinge whereof, they sayde that the lorde mar-
ques hadde entered into the tower of london, and
thence taken out the kinges treafor, and sent menne to
the sea. all whiche thinge these dukes wiste well were
done for good purposes and necessari by the whole coun-
faile at london, sauing that sommewhat thei must sai.
vnto whiche woordes, the king aunswered, what my
brother marques hath done i cannot saie. but in good
faith i dare well aunswere for myne vncle riuers and
my brother here, that thei be innocent of any such
matters. ye my liege quod the duke of buckingham
thei haue kepte theire dealing in these matters farre fro
the knowledge of your good grace. and foorthwith
thei arrested the lord richarde and sir thomas waughan
knighte, in the kinges presence, and broughte the king
and all backe vnto northampton, where they tooke
againe further counsaile. and there they sent awaie from
the kinge whom it pleased them, and sette newe
seruantes aboute him, suche as lyked better them than
him. at whiche dealinge hee wepte and was nothing
contente, but it booted not. and at dyner the duke of
gloucester sente a dishe from his owne table to the lord
riuers, prayinge him to bee of good chere, all should
be well inough. and he thanked the duke, and prayed
the messenger to beare it to his nephewe the lorde ri-
chard with the same message for his comfort, who he
thought had more nede of comfort, as one to whom
fuch aduersitie was straunge. but himself had been al
his dayes in vre there with, and therfore coulde beare it
the better. but for al this counfortable courtesye of
the duke of gloucester he sent the lord riuers and the
lorde richarde with sir thomas vaughan into the
northe countrey into digers places to prison, and after-
ward al to pomfrait, where they were in conclusion
beheaded.

none has been more frequently celebrated than the earl
of surry; and this history would therefore have been
imperfect without some specimens of his works, which
yet it is not easy to distinguish from those of sir thomas
wyat and others, with which they are confounded in the
edition that has fallen into my hands. the three first are,
i believe, surry's ; the rest, being of the sume age, are se-
lested, some as examples of different measures, and one as
the oldest composition which i have found in blank verse.

somer is come, for cycry spray now springes,
the hart hath hunge hys olde head on the pale,
the bucke in brake his winter coate he flynges;
the fishes flete with newe repayred scale:
the adder all her slough away she synges,
the swift swallow pursueth the flyes smalle,
the busy bee her honey how she mynges;
winter is worne that was the floures bale.
and thus i see among these pleasant thynges
eche care decayes, and yet my sorrow sprynges.
descripcion of the restless estate of a lover.
wilso youth had led me half the race,
that cupides scourge had made me runne;
i looked back to meet the place,
from whence my weary course begunne:
and then i saw howe my desyre
misguiding me had led the waye,
myne eyne to greedy of theyre hyre,
had made me lose a better prey.
for when in sighes i spent the day,
and could not cloake my grics with game;
the boyling smoke dyd still bewray,
the present heat of secret slaine:
and when salt teares do bayne my breast,
where love his pleasent traynes hath sown,
her beauty oth the fruytes opprest,
ere that the buddes were spronge and blowne.
and when myne eyen dyd still pursue,
the flying chase of theyre request;
theyre greedy looks dyd oft renew,
the hydden wounde within my brefle.
when every looke these cheekes might slayne,
from dedly pale to glowing red; -
by outward signes appeared playne,
to her for helpe my hart was fied.
but all to late love learneth me,
to paynt all kynd of colours new ;
to blynd theyre eyes that else should see
my speckled cockes with cupids hew.
and now the covert brest i clame,
that worshipt cupide secretely;
and nourished hys sacred flame,
from whence no blairing sparks do flye.
description of the fickle asseations, pangs, and sleightes
of love.
such wayward wayes bath love, that most part
in discord
our willes do stand, whereby our hartes but seldom
do accord:
decyte is hys delighte, and to begyle and mocke
the simple hartes which he doth strike with froward
divers stroke.
he causeth th' one to rage with golden burning darte,
and doth alay with leaden cold, again the others harte.
whose gleames of burning fyre and easy sparkes of flame,
in balance of unequal weyght he pondereth by ame
from easye ford where i myghte wade and pass full well,
he me o and doth mc drive, into a depe dark
hell: -
and me witholdes where i am calde and offred place,
and willes me that my mortal foe 1 do beseke of grace;
he lettes me to pursue a conquest welnere wonne
to follow where my paynes were lost, ere that my sute
begunne.
so by this means i know how soon a hart may turne
from warse to peace, from truce to stryfe, and so
agayne returne.
i know how to content my self in others lust,
of little stuffe unto my self to weave a webbe of trust:
and how to hyde my harmes with sole dyssembling
chere,
whan in my face the painted thoughtes would out-
wardly appeare.
i know how that the bloud forsakes the face for dred,
and how by shame it staynes agayne the chekes with
flamyng red:
i know understhe grene, the serpent how he lurkes:
the hamme; of the restless forge i wote eke how it
wotkes.

the vertue of her lively lookes
excels the precious stone,
i wishe to have none other bookes
to reade or look upon.
in eche of her two christall eyes,
smyleth a naked boy;
it would you all in heart suffise
to see that lampe of joye.
i think nature hath lost the moulde,
where she her shape did take ;
or else i doubte if nature coulde
so fayre a creature make.
she may be well comparde
unto the phenix kinde,
whose like was never scene nor heard,
that any man can fynde.
in lyfe she is diana chast

what will you more we say:
if all the world were sought so farre,
who could finde suche a wight,
her beauty twinkleth lyke a starre

the lover refused of his love, embraceth vertue,
my youthfull yeres are past,

mockers and scorners that are harde of beleue,
with a roogh combe here will i clawe and grate,
to proue if they will from their vice reneuc,
and leaue their folly, which causeth great debate:
suche caytiues spare neyther poore man nor estate,
and where their selfe are moste worthy derision,
other men to scorne is all their most condition.
yet are no fooles of this abuson,
whiche of wise men despiseth the doctrine,
with mowes, mockes, scorne, and collusion,
rewarding rebukes for their good discipline:
shewe to fuche wisdome, yet shall they not enclin
unto the same, but set nothing therby,
but mocke thy doctrine, still or openiy.
so in the worlde it appeareth commonly,
that who that will a foole rebuke or blame,
a mocke or mowe sha'i he haue by and by:
thus in derision baue fooles their speciall game.

and him that him teacheth taketh for his frende,
him selfe putting mekely unto subjestion,

but yf that one a foole rebuke or blame,
ihe shall his teacher hate, slaunder and disfame.
howbeit his wordes oft turne to his own shame,

and so is he fore wounded with the fame,

he that goeth right, stedfast, sure, and fast,

and he that is white may well his scornes cast,

but who that of sinne is cleane in deede and thought,

about the year 1553 wrote dr. wilson, a man cele-
brated for the politeness of his style, and the cxtent of
his knowledge: what was the state of our language in
his time, the following may be of use to show.
p ronunciation is an apte orderinge bothe of the voyce,
countenaunce, agd all the whole bodye, accordynge
to the worthines of suche woordes and mater as by
speache are declared. the vse hereof is suche for anye
one that liketh to haue prayse for tellynge his tale in open
asseinblie, that hauing a good tongue, and a comelye
countenance, he shal be thought to passe all other that
haue the like voteraunce: thoughe they haue much bet-
ter learning. the tongue geueth a certayne grace to
cuerye matter, and beautifieth the cause in like maner,
as a swete foundynge lute muche setteth for the a meane
decised ballade. or as the sounde of a good instrumente
styrreth the hearers, and moueth muche delite, so a
cleare soundyng voice comforteth muche our deintie
eares, with muche swete melodie, and causeth vs to al-
lowe the matter rather for the reporters sake, then the
reporter for the matters sake. demosthenes therfore,
that famouse oratour, beyng asked what was the chiefest
point in al oratorie, gaue the chiefe and onely praise to
pronunciation; being demaunded, what was the seconde,
and the thirde, he stil made answere, pronunciation,
and would make none other aunswere, till they lefte
askyng, declaryng hereby that arte without vtteraunce
can dooe nothyng, voteraunce without arte can dooc
right muche. and no doubte that man is in outwarde
apparaunce halfe a good clarke, that hath a cleane
tongue, and a comely gesture of his body. aeschines
lykwyse beyng bannished his countrie through demosthe-
nes, when he had redde to the rhodians his own oration,
and demosthenes aunswere thereunto, by force whereof
he was bannished, and all they marueiled muche at the
excellencie of the same : then (q d aeschines) you
would have marueiled muche more if you had heard
hymselfe speak it. thus beyng cast in miserie and ban-
nished for euer, he could not but geue such great re-
porte of his deadly and mortal ennemy.

first rudencss to its present elegance.

e n g l i s h t o n g u e.
r a m m a r, which is the art of using words
properly, comprises four parts; orthography,
etymology, syntax, and prosody.
in this division and order of the parts of grammar i follow the
common grammarians, without enquiring whether a fitter distribution
might not be found. experience has long shown this method to be
so distinct as to obviate confusion, and so comprehensive as to prevent
any inconvenient omissions. i likewise use the terms already re-
ceived, and already understood, though perhaps others more proper
might sometimes be invented. sylburgius, and other innovators,
whose new terms have sunk their learning into neglect, have left suf-
ficient warning against the trifling ambition of teaching arts in a new
language.
orthog raphy is the art of combining letters into syl-
lables, and syllables into words. it therefore teaches pre-
viously the form and sound of letters.

to these may be added certain combinations of
letters universally used in printing ; as ct, st, fl, sl,
{b, sk, f, ss, si, sli, fi, sfi, fl, and &amp;, or and per
jo, aud. &amp; ff, f, s, so, so, f, so so, si, ji, so so, to
ti, st, ii, ii, ii., ii., ii, isi, fi, fu, 't.
our letters are commonly reckoned twenty-four, because anciently
# and j, as well as u and v, were expressed by the same character;
but as those letters, which had always different powers, have now
different forms, our alphabet may be properly said to confist of
twenty six letters.
none of the small consonants have a double form, excepts, ; of
which / is used in the beginning and middle, and at the end.
r -
vowels are five, a, e, i, o, u.
such is the number generally received; but for i it is
the practice to write y in the end of words, as thy, holy ;
before i, as from die, dying ; from beautify, beautifying ;
in the words says, days, eyes; and in words derived from
the greek, and written originally with 9, as system,
ov$o 2, sympathy, avorzysz.
for u we often write w after a vowel, to make a
diphthong; as raw, grew, view, vow, flowing, low:
mess.
the sounds of all the letters are various.
in treating on the letters, i shall not, like some other gramma-
rians, enquire into the original of their form as an antiquarian: nor
into their formation and prolation by the organs of speech, as a me-
chanick, anatomist, or physiologist; nor into the properties and gra-
dation of founds, or the elegance or harshness of particular combina-
tions, as a writer of universal and transcendental grammar. i con-
fider the fnglish alphabet only as it is english; and even in this nar-
row disquisition i follow the example of former grammarians, perhaps
with more reverence than judgment, because by writing in fnglish i
suppose my reader already acquainted with the english language;
and consequently able to pronounce the letters, of which i teach the
pronunciation ; and because of founds in general it may be ob-
served, that words are unable to describe them. an account there-
fore of the primitive and simple letters is useless almost alike to those
who know their found, and those who know it not. -
of v o w e l s.
a.
a has three sounds, the slender, open, and broad.
a slender is found in most words, as face, mane ; and
in words ending in ation, as creation, salvation, genera-
11077.
the a slender is the proper englisha, called very justly by erpenius,
in his arabick grammar, a 4-glican cum e misuni, as having a middle
sound between the open a and the e. the french have a similar
found in the word pair, and in their e masculine. -
a open is the a of the italian, or nearly resembles it;
as father, rather, congratulate, fancy, glas.
a broad resembles the a of the german; as all,
wall, call,
many words rronounced with a broad were anciently written
with au, as sazo, wault ; and we still say fault, vault. this was
probably the saxon found, for it is yet retained in the northern dia-
lects, and in the rustick pronunciation ; as maun for man, haund for
hand. -
the short a approaches to the a open, as gras.
. the longa, if prolonged by e at the end of the word,
is always slender, as graze, same.
a forms a diphthong only with i or y, and u or w.
a or gy, as in plain, wain, gay, clay, has only the sound
of the long and slender a, and differs not in the pronun-
ciation from plane, wane.
au or aw has the found of the german a, as razo,
maighty.
ae is sometimes found in latin words not compleatly naturalised or
assimilated, but is no english diphthong; and is more properly ex-

e. -
e is the letter which occurs most frequently in the english lan-
guage.
-- e is long, as in scene; or short, as in cellar, sparate,
colebrate, mon, th&amp;n.
it is always short before a double consonant, or two
consonants, as in vaz, perplexity, relent, medlar, reptile,
jarpent, ceilar, coffalion, blosing, foll, folling, debt.
e is always mute at the end of a word, except in mo-
nosyllables that have no other vowel, as the ; or proper
names, as penelope, phebe, derbe; being used to mo-
dify the foregoing consonant, as since, once, ledge,
oblige; or to lengthen the preceding vowel, as bam,
bine ; c.in, cone; pin, pine; tin, tine; rab, robe ; pop,
pope; for, fire; cir, cire; tib, tibe.
almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended an-
ciently in e, as year, yeare; wildness, wildness; which e probably had
the force of the french e feminine, and constituted a syllable with its
associate consonant; for, in old editions, words are sometimes di-
vided thus, cleare, sol le knowledge. this e was perhaps for a time
vocal or silent in poetry as convenience required ; but it has been
long wholly mute. camden in his remains calls it the silent e.
it does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel, as
glove, live, give.
it has sometimes in the end of words a sound ob-
scure, and scarcely perceptible, as open, shapel, socioen,
thistle, participle, sucre.
this faintness of sound is found when e separates a mute from a
liquid, as in rotten ; or follows a mute and liquid, as in cattle.
e forms a diphthong with a, as me r , with i, as deign,
receive ; and with to or w, as new, few.
ea sounds like e long, as mean ; or like ee, as dear,
clear, near.
ei is sounded like e long, as size, perceiving.
eu sounds as u long and soft.
e., a, u are combined in beauty and its derivatives,
but have only the sound of u. -
e may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication,
as agree, sloping.
e2 is found in yeomer, where it is sounded as e short; and in pole,
where it is pronounced like ce.
i.
i has a sound, long, as fine; and short, as fin.
that is eminently observable in i, which may be 1. rewise remarked
in other letters, that the short found is not the long sound contracted,
but a sound wholly doerent.
the long sound in monosyllables is always marked by
the e final, as too, to me.
i is often sounded before r as a short u ; as firt, firs?,
shirt.
it forms a diphthong only with e, as fie’s, sicid, which
is sounded as the double te; cxcept friend, which is
‘sounded as find.
i is joined with eu in lieu, and ew in view ; which triphthongs are
founded as the open w.
o
o is long, as one, oedient, corroding ; or short, as
block, knack, oblique, loss.
s!'omen is pronounced time;;.
the short o has sometimes the sound of a close u, as son, corne.
o coalesces into a diphthong with a, as incan, groan,
approach ; ca has the sound of o long.
o is united to e in some words derived from greek, as acconomy;
but of being not an english diphthong, they are better written as they
are sounded, with only e, economy.
with i, as oil, soil, moil, moisome.
this coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two let-
ters as far as two founds can be united without being destroyed, and
therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue
to the notion of a diphthong.
with c, as boot, hoot, cooler; oo has the sound of the
italian u.
with u or w, as our, power, flower; but in some
words has only the found of o long, as in soul, bowl,
fow, grow. these different sounds are used to distin-
guish different significations; as bow, an instrument for
shooting; bow, a depression of the head: sow, the she
of a boar; sow, to scatter seed: bowl, an orbicular bo-
dy ; bowl, a wooden vessel.
ou is sometimes pronounced like o soft, as court;
sometimes like o short, as cough; sometimes like a close,
as could , or u open, as rough, tough , which use only
can teach.
ou is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in latin
end in or, and are made english, as honour, labour, favour, from
aonor, labor, favor.
some late innovators have ejected the u, without considering that
the last syllable gives the sound neither of or nor ur, but a sound be-
tween them, if not compounded of both ; besides that they are pro-
bably derived to us from the french nouns in eur, as honeur, saveur.
u.
u is long in i̇se, confosion ; or short, as is, concos.
son.
it coalesces with a, e, i, o ; but has rather in these
combinations the force of the ty, as quaff, ques, quit,
quite, languish ; sometimes in ai the i loses its found, as
in juice. it is sometimes mute before a, e, i, j, as
guard, guoso, guise, buy.
u is followed by e in virtue, but the e has no sound.
ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word, in imitation of the
freech, as prorogue, saagogo, pague, vague, waraogue.
y.
2’ is a vowel, which, as quintilian observes of one
of the roman letters, we might want without inconve-
nience, but that we have it. it supplies the place of
i at the end of words, as thy; before an i, as dying ;
and is commonly retained in derivative words where it
was part of a diphthong in the primitive; as desiroy, de-
jiroyer; betray, betrayed, betrayer; pray, prayer; say,
soyer ; day, days.
1 being the saxon vowely, which was commonly used where i is
now put, occurs very frequently in all old books.
g e n e r a l r u l e s.
a vowel in the beginning or middle syllable, before
two consonants, is commonly short, as opportunity.
in monosyllables a single vowel before a single conso-
nant is short, as slag, frog.
many is pronounced as if it were written many.
of c o n s o n a n t s.
b.
b has one unvaried sound, such as it obtains in other
languages. o
it is mute in debt, deb!or, subtle, doubt, lamb, limb,
dumb, thumb, climb, comb, womb.
it is used before l and r, as black, brown.
c. -" -
c has before e and i the sound of s, as sincerey, co-
trick, century, circular, cistern, city, so city : before a, o,
and u, it sounds like k, as calm, concavity, copper, in-
corporate, curiosily, concupiscence. o
c might be omitted in the language without loss, since one of its
founds might be supplied by j, and the other by k, but that it pre-
serves to the eye the etymology of words, as face from facies, cap-
tive from captivus. - -
ch has a found which is analysed into tsh, as church,
chil, crutch. it is the same found which the italians
give to the c simple before i and e, as citta, corro.
ca is founded like k in words derived from the greek,
as chymist, scheme, choser. arch is commonly founded
ark before a vowel, as archargel; and with the english
found of ch before a consonant, as arch&amp;shop.
ch, in some french words not yet assimilated, sounds like so, as
machine, chaise.
c, having no determinate sound, according to english orthography,
never ends a word; therefore we write slick, took, which were ori-
ginally slicke, blocke, in such words. c is now mute.
it is used before l and r, as clock, cross.
id.
is uniform in its sound, as death, diligent.
it is used before r, as draw, dross; and ‘w, as dwell,
f.
f, though having a name beginning with a vowel, it
is numbered by the grammarians among the semi-
vowels, yet has this quality of a mure, that it is com-
modiously sounded before a liquid, as flask, fly, freckle.
it has an unvariable found, except that of is sometimes
spoken nearly as ov.
- g.
g has two sounds, one hard, as in gay, go, gun ; the
other soft, as in gem, giant. a

:
3.
at the end of a word it is always hard, ring, snig,
jong, frog.
before e and i the sound is uncertain.
g before e is soft, as gem, generation, except in gear,
geld, geese, get, gewgaw, and derivatives from words
ending in g, as songing, stronger, and generally before er
at the end of words, as finger.
g is mute before m, as gnosh, sign, foreign.
g before i is hard, as give, except in giant, gigantick,
gibbet, gibe, giblets, giles, gill, gillflower, gin, ginger,
gingle, to which may be added egypt and gypsy.
gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the
hard g, as ghosily; in the middle, and sometimes at the
end, it is quite silent, as though, right, sought, spoken
tho’, rite, sotte.
it has often at the end the sound of f, as laugh;
whence laughter retains the same sound in the middle ;
cough, trough, sough, tough, enough, slough.
it is not to be doubted, but that in the original pronunciation gh
had the force of a consonant, deeply guttural, which is still conti-
nued among the scotch.
g is used before b, s, and r.
h.
h is a note of aspiration, and shows that the following
vowel must be pronounced with a strong emission of the
breath, as hat, horse.
it seldom begins any but the first syllable, in which
it is always founded with a full breath, except in heir,
herb, hostler, honour, humble, honoff, humour, and their
derivatives. -
it sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded,
as blockhead; or derived from the latin, as comprehended.
j consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g, and is
therefore a letter useless, except in etymology, as ja-
culation, josier, jocund, juice.
k. -
k has the sound of hard c, and is used before e and i,
where, according to english analogy, c would be soft,
as kept, king, skirt, skeptick, for so it should be written,
not sceptick, because so is sounded like s, as in scene.
it is used before n, as knell, knot, but totally loses its found in mo-
dern pronunciation.
k is never doubled; but c is used before it to shorten
the vowel by a double consonant, as cackle, pickle.
l.
l has in english the same liquid sound as in other
languages. o
the custom is to double the 1 at the end of monosyllables, as kill,
will, full. these words were originally written kille, withe, fille ;
and when the e first grew silent, and was afterwards omitted the
ll was retained, to give force, according to the analogy of our lan-
guage, to the foregoing vowel. -
l is sometimes mute, as in ca's, half, halves, calves,
could, would, should, psalm, talk, salmon, falcon.
the saxon, who delighted in guttural sounds, sometimes aspirated
the l at the beginning of words, as hlar, a loaf, or bread; hlaponso,
a lord; but this pronunciation is now disused. -
le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el,
in which the e is almost mute, as table, shuttle.
m.
m has always the same sound, as murmur, mont-
mental. -
n.
n has always the same sound, as noble, manners.
n is sometimes mute after m, as damm, condemn,
hymn.
p.
p has always the same found, which the welsh and
germans confound with b.
p is sometimes mute, as in psalm, and between m and
t, as temp!.
ph is used for fin words derived from the greek, as
philosopher, philanthropy, philip. *
q, as in other languages, is always followed by u,
and has a sound which our saxon ancestors well ex-
pressed by cp, cw, as quadrant, queen, equestrian, quilt,
enquiry, quire, quotidian. qu is never followed by u.
qu is sometimes sounded, in words derived from the
french, like k, as conquer, liquor, risque, chequer.
r.
r has the same rough snarling found as in other
tongues.
the saxons used often to put b before it, as before 1 at the be-
ginning of words.
rh is used in words derived from the greek, as myrrh, myrrhino,
catarrhous, rheum, rheumatick, rhyme.
re, at the end of some words derived from the latin
or french, is pronounced like a weak er, as theatre,
spulchre.
s.
s has a hissing found, as sibilation, sifter.
a fingle s seldom ends any word, except the third person of verbs,
as loves, grows; and the plurals of nouns, as treet, busher, diffrase: ;
the pronouns this, his, ours, yours, us; the adverb thus ; and words
derived from latin, as resus, surplus ; the close being always either
in so, as house, horse, or in ji, as gra/#, dress, boys, lys, anciently
grase, drose.
s single, at the end of words, has a groser sound,
like that of z, as trees, eyes, except this, thus, us, rebus,
surplus.
it sounds like z before ion, if a vowel goes before,
as intrusion; and like s, if it follows a consonant, as
conversion. e
it sounds like z before e mute, as rifs, and before
sy final, as rosy ; and in those words, bosom, desire, wis-
dom, prison, prisoner, present, present, damsci, c sement.
it is the peculiar quality of /, that it may be sounded before all
consonants, except x and x., in which / is comprised, x being only
#s, and z a hard or gross /. this / is therefore termed by gram-
marians suae pote: at is litera; the reason of which the learned dr.
clarke erroneously supposed to be, that in some words it might be
doubled at pleasure. thus we find in several languages:
x onto, s atter, sogno, sarucciolo, savcilare, e.g., *, 'gomłrare,
joranare, soake, sumeer, smell. jaipe, space splendour, aring, seese,
forew, step, strengo, framen, / ripe, joventura, swell.
s is mute in isle, island, donesie, viscount.
t.
t has its customary sound, as take, temptation.
ti before a vowel has the sound of so, as salvation,
except an s goes before, as question, excepting likewise
derivatives from words ending in ty, as mighty, migłlier.
to has two founds; the one soft, as thus, whether ;
the other hard, as thing, think. the sound is soft in
these words, them, thence, and there, with their deriva-
tives and compounds; and in that, thos, thou, thee,
thy, thine, their, they, this, those, them, though, thus,
and in all words between two vowels, as father, whether;
and between r and a vowel, as burthen.
in other words it is hard, as thick, thunder, faith,
faithful. where it is softened at the end of a word, an e
silent must be added, as treath, breathe; cloth, cloths.
v.
w has a sound of near affinity to that of f, vain,
vanity.
from sin the islandick alphabet, v is only distinguished by a dia-
critical point.
- w
of w, which in diphthongs is often an undoubted
vowel, some grammarians have doubted whether it
ever be a consonant; and not rather as it is called a
double u or ou, as water may be resolved into cuater;
but letters of the same found are always reckoned conso-
nants in other alphabets: and it may be observed, that
w follows a vowel without any hiatus or difficulty of
utterance, as frosty winter.
wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the english,
which the saxons better expressed by hp, hw, as what,
whence, whiting; in whore only, and sometimes in
wholesome, wb is sounded like a simple h.
x.
x begins no english word; it has the sound of ks,
as axle, extraneous.
y.
7, when it follows a consonant, is a vowel; when it
precedes either vowel or diphthong, is a consonant,
je, young. it is thought by some to be in all cases a
vowel. but it may be observed of y as of w, that it
follows a vowel without any hiatus, as roy youth.
the chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels
is, that the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants,
cannot be uttered after a vowel, like that of all other consonants;
thus we say, tu, ut; do, odd; but in wed, dew, the two sounds of
ow have no resemblance of each other.
z.

z.
z begins no word originally english; it has the
sound, as its name izzard or f hard expresses, of an
s uttered with closer compression of the palate by the
tongue, as freeze, froze.
in orthography i have supposed orthopy, or jus’ utterance of words,
to be included; orthography being only the art of expressing certain
founds by proper characters. i have therefore observed in what words
any of the letters are mute.
most of the writers of english grammar have given long tables of
words pronounced otherwise than they are written, and seem not suf-
ficiently to have considered, that of english, as of all living tongues,
there is a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquiai, the other
regular and solemn. the cursory pronunciation is always vague and
mncertain, being made different in different mouths by negligence,
unskilfulness, or affectation. the solemn pronunciation, though by
no means immutable and permanent, is yet always less remote from
the orthography, and less liable to capricious innovation. they
have however generally formed their tables according to the cursory
speech of those with whom they happened to converse; and conclud-
ing that the whole nation combines to vitiate language in one man-
ner, have often established the jargon of the lowest of the people as
the model of speech.
for pronunciation the best general rule is, to consider those as the
most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words.
there have been many schemes offered for the emendation and
settlement of our orthography, which, like that of other nations,
being formed by chance, or according to the fancy of the earliest
writers in rude ages, was at first very various and uncertain, and is
yer sufficiently irregular. of these reformers some have endeavoured
to accommodate orthography better to the pronunciation, without
considering that this is to measure by a shadow, to take that for a
nodel or standard which is changing while they apply it. others,
less absurdly indeed, but with equal unlikelihood of success, have
cndeavoured to proportion the number of letters to that of sounds,
that every sound may have its own character, and every character
a single found. such would be the orthography of a new language
to be formed by a synod of grammarians upon principles of science.
but who can hope to prevail on nations to change their practice, and
make all their old books useless : or what advantage would a new
orthography procure equivalent to the confusion and perplexity of
such an alteration
some of these schemes i shall however exhibit, which may be used
according to the diversities of genius, as a guide to reformers, or
terroun to 1 nilovators.
one of the first who proposed a scheme of regular orthography,
was sir thomas smith, secretary of state to queen elizabeth, a man
of real learning, and much practised in grammatical disquisitions.
had he written the following lines according to his scheme, they
would have appeared thus: -
at length erasmus, that great injur'd name,
the glory of the priesthood, and the shame,
stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age,
and drove those holy vandals off the stage.
at leng’s erasmus, 8 at gret in 5urd nam,
ae glori of se ptesthud, and se zan,
stemma ce wild torrent of a barb'rous 33,
and drow 86, heli vandals off &amp; staz.
after him another mode of writing was offered by dr. gill, the
celebrated master of st. paul’s school in london; which i cannot
represent exactly for want of types, but will approach as nearly as i
can by means of characters now in use, so as to make it understood,
exhibiting two stanzas of spenser in the reformed orthography.
spenser, book iii. canto 5.
unthankful wretch, said he, is this the meed,

dr. gill was followed by charles butler, a man who did not want
an understanding which might have qualified him for better en-
ployment. he seems to have been more sanguine than his prede-
cessors, for he printed his book according to his own scheme; which
the following speciumen will make easily understood.
but whensoever you have occasion to trouble their patience, or to
come among them being troubled, it is better to stand upon your

gered, a little piece half a quarter broad, to cover the eyes and parts
about them, may serve though it be in the heat of the day.

in the time of charles i. there was a very prevalent inclination
to change the orthography; as appears, among other books, in such
editions of the works of milton as were published by himself. of
these reformers every man had his own scheme ; but they agreed in
one general design of accommodating the letters to the pronuncia-
tion, by ejecting such as they thought superauous. some of them
would have written these lines thus:
—all the erth
shall then be paradis, far happier place
than this of eden, and far happier dais.
bishop wilkins afterwards, in his great work of the philosophical
language, proposed, without expecting to be followed, a regular or-
thography; by which the lord's prayer is to be written thus:
yar fa her heitsh art in heven, halloed bidhyinem, dhyi cing yin yn, dhy will
bidyn in erth as it is in heven, &amp;c.
we have since had no general reformers; but some ingenious men
have endeavoured to deserve well of their country, by writing boxer
and labor for honour and labour, red for read in the preter-tense, sai;
for says, repete for repeat, explane for explain, or declame for declaim.
of these it may be said, that as they have done no good, they have
done little harm ; both because they have innovated little, aid le-
cause few have followed them.
the english language has properly no dialests; the stile of writers
has no professed diversity in the use of words, or of their flexions,
and terminations, nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care.
the oral diction is uniform in no spacious country, but has less va-
riation in fngland than in most other nations of equal extent. the
language of the northern counties retains many words now out of
use, but which are commonly of the genuine teutonick race, and is
uttered with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough, but
was probably used by our ancestors. the northern speech is there-
fore not barbarous but obsolete. the speech in the western provinces
seems to differ from the general diction rather by a depraved pronun-
ciation, than by any real difference which letters would cxpress.

some reference to more; as, this is a good book, that is,

languages by prepositions, unless we may be said to
have a genitive cale.
singular.
* nom. magister, a master, the master.
gen. magistri, of a master, of the master, or
masters, the masters.
magistro, to a master, to the master.
acc. magistrum, a master, the master.
voc. magister, master, o master.
abl. magistro, from a master, from the master.
dat.
plural.
nom. magistri, masters, the masters.
gen. magistrorum, of masters, of the masters.
dat. magistris, to masters, to the masters.
acc. magittros, masters, the masters.
voc. magistri, masters, o masters.
abl. magistris, from masters, from the masters.
our nouns are therefore only declined thus:
master, gen. masters. plur. masters.
scholar, gen. scholars. plur. scholars.
these genitives are always written with a mark of elision, master's,
scholar's, according to an opinion long received, that the ’s is a con-
traction of his, as the soldier's valour, for the soldier his valour ; but this
cannot be the true original, because ’s is put to female nouns, wo-
man's beauty; the pirgin's delicago; haughty juno's unrelenting hate :
and collective nouns, as j/omen posions ; the rabble's insolence; the
multitude's foil, ; in all these cases it is apparent that his cannot be
understood. we say likewise, the foundation's strength, the diamond's
iuffre, the winter's severity; but in these cases his may be understood,
he and his having formerly been applied to neuters in the place now
supplied by it and its.
the learned and sagacious wallis, to whom every english gram-
marian owes a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the
noun an adjoive fo/offive ; i think with no more propriety than he
might have applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus, 7 roje
oris, or any other latin genitive. dr. lowth, on the other part,
supposes the possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases.
this termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive
indicating possession. . it is derived to us from those who declined
rmis, a smith; gen. rmiser, of a sooth; piur, rritor, or rmissio,
jaito and so in two coher of their seven decle::vas.
it is a further confirmation of this opi.icm, that in the no one's
both the genitive and plural were longer by a silable than the coal
word; knitis, for anglo's, in chaucer; leavis, for loaves, in spoor.
when a word ends in , the genitive may be the same with the
nominative, as p'enus temple.
the plural is formed by adding s, as talle, teles;
fy, flies ; sifter, sers ; wood, wood, ; or es whores could
not otherwise be founded, as after ch, s, sj, x, z, after
c sounded like s, and g like j; the mute e is vocal be-
fore 3, as lence, lance: ; outrage, outrages.
the formation of the plural and genitive singular is the same.
a few words yet make the plural in n, as men, women, cren,
joine, and more anciently even and shoon... i his formation is that
which generally prevails in the teutonick dialects.
words that end in f commonly form their plural by
ves, as loof, leaves ; calf, calves.
except a few, ruff, muff; ; chief, chi- 3. so hoof, roof, proof re-
lis, mischief, puff, cuff, dwarf, handkerchief, grief.
irregular !. are teeth from tooth, lice from lous, rice from
moso, geese from goose, set from scot, dice from do, pence from anny,
brethren from brother, children from child.
plurals ending in s have for the most part no gen:-
tives; but we say, womens excellencies, and //eigh the
mens wits agains the ladies hairs. pope.
dr. wallis thinks the lord, hows may be said for the hous of izroy;
but such phrases are not now in use; and surely an e.g.: ear re-
bels against them. they would commonly produce a troublessie
ambiguity, as the lord's house may be the 5 or of lord, or to of
a lord. lesides that the mark of clision is improper, for in to l., ...,'
house nothing is cut cof.
some english substantives, like those of many other languares,
change their termination as they express different sexes, as force,
prince/; ; actor, a.org/? ; iion, liary; ; hero, heroines to these
mentioned by dr. lowth may be added arbitro, frees, cano-
tress, duoso, togress, governs, titress prero, allory?, toy-
tro/*, and perhaps others. of these variable terminations we have
only a suicient number to make us feel our want, for when we say
of a woman that she is a philosopher, an affronzmer, a kor, a
weaver, a dancer, we perceive an impropriety in the termination
which we cannot avoid; but we can say that she is an arch:...?, a /2-
tano, a student, because these terminations have not annexed to then
the notion of sex. in words which the necessities of life are often re-
quiring, the sex is distinguished not by different terminations but by
different names, as a ball, a cow ; a horse, a mare; equio, equit; a
cock, a hen; and sometimes by pronouns prefixed, as a he-goat, a
she-goat. -
of a d j e c t 1 v e s.
adjectives in the english language are wholly inde-
clinable; having neither case, gender, nor number, and
being added to substantives in all relations without any
change ; as, a good woman, good women, of a good wa-
man a good man, good such, of good men.
the comparison of ajesves.
the comparative degree of adjectives is formed by
adding er, the superlative by adding off, to the positive;
as fair, fairer, fairs!; lovely, lovelier, lovelis; ; sweet,
sweeter, sweets ; low, lower, lows ; high, higher,
highest. -
some words are irregularly compared; as good, better,
beft; bad, worse, worst ; little, loss, least; near, nearer,
next ; much, more, most ; many (or moe), more (for moer),
mosi (for moost); late, latter, lates; or last.
some comparatives form a superlative by adding most,
as mether, methermoff ; outer, outmost ; under, undermost ;
up, upper, uppermos; , fore, former, foremosi. -
most is sometimes added to a substantive, as topmost,
southmosi.
many adjectives do not admit of comparison by ter-
minations, and are only compared by more and most, as
benevolent, more benevolent, most benevolent.
all adjectives may be compared by more and most,
even when they have comparatives and superlatives re-
gularly formed ; as fair; fairer, or more fair; fairest,
or most fair.
in adjectives that admit a regular comparison, the comparative more
is oftener used than the superlative mosł, as more fair is oftener written
for sairer, than off fair for faires.
the comparison of adjectives is very uncertain ; and
being much regulated by commodiousness of utter-
ance, or agreeableness of sound, is not easily reduced to
rules.
monosyllables are commonly compared.
polysyllables,
|
</p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 60</div><p class="text">a g r a m m a r o f t h e
polysyllables, or words of more than two syllables,
are seldom compared otherwise than by more and moso,
as deplorable, more deplorable, most deplorable. - -
disyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in
some, as fulfome, toilsome; in ful, as careful, fpleenful,
dreadful; in ing, as triffing, charming; in ous, as poro
in less, as careless, harmless ; in ed, as wretched; in id,
as candid; in al, as mortal; in ent, as recent, fervent;
in ain, as certain; in ive, as missive; in dy, as woody :
in fy, as puffy; in ky, as rocky, except lucky; in "y,
as roomy; in my, as skinny 5 in py, as ropy, except happy;
in ry, as hoary.
some comparatives and superlatives are yet found in good writers
formed without regard to the foregoing rules; but in a language
subjected so little and so lately to grammar, such anomalies must fre-
quently occur.
so shady is compared by milton.
she in shadies' covert hid,
tun’d her nocturnal note. parad. loft.
and virtuous. -
what she wills to say or do,
seems wisest, virtuous/s, discreetest, best. parad. loff.
so trifting, by ray, who is indeed of no great authority.
it is not so decorous, in respect of god, that he should im-
mediately do all the meanell and triffinges; things himself, with-
out making use of any inferior or subordinate minister.

tongues in all matters. a/cham's schoolmasier.

the mortal:/? poisons practised by the west indians, have
some mixture of the blood, fat, or flesh of man. bacon.
natural, by wotton.
1 will now deliver a few of the properest and naturalles' con-
siderations that belong to this piece. wotton's architecture.
wretched, by johnson.
the wretcheder are the contemners of all helps; such as pre-
suming on their own naturals, deride diligence, and mock at
terms when they undersland not things. ben johnson.
powerful, by milton.
we have sustain'd one day in doubtful fight,
what heav'n's great king hath pow'rfully to send
against us from about his throne. paradis. loft.
the termination in ish may be accounted in some sort a degree of
comparison, by which the signification is diminished below the posi-
tive, as black, blackish, or tending to blackness; salt, salti/%, or having
a little taste of salt: they therefore admit no comparison. this ter-
mination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible qualities,
nor often to words of above one syllable, and is scarcely used in the
solemn or sublime style.

the possessive of the first person is my, mine, car,
ours; of the second, thy, thine, you, jours; of the third,
from be, bis, from she, her, and hero, and in the plural
their, theirs, for both sexes.
our, yours, hers, theirs, are used when the substantive preceding is
separated by a verb, as these are, our books. these books, are ours.
your oildon excel ours inflature, but ours/arpa/, yours in learning.
our, yours, hers, theirs, notwithstanding their feorhing plural ter-
mination, are applied equally to fingular and plural substantives, as
this book is ours. these books are ours.
min, and one were formerly used before a vowel, as mine amiable
lady; which though now disused in prose, might be still properly
continued in poetry, they are used as ours and yours, and are referred
to a substantive preceding, as, thy house is larger than mine, but my
garden is more spacious than thine.
their and theirs are the possessives likewise of they,
when they is the plural of it, and are therefore applied to
things.

whosoever, whatsoever.

whether is only used in the nominative and accusative cases; and
has no plural, being applied only to one of a number, commonly to
one of two, as, whether of these is left i know not. whether shall i

therefore and wherefore, which are properly, there for
and where for, for that, for which, are now reckoned con-
junetions, and continued in use. the rest seem to be
passing by degrees into neglect, though proper, useful,
and analogous. they are referred both to singular and
plural antecedents. -
there are two more words used only in conjunction
with pronouns, own and self.
own is added to possessives, both singular and plural,
as my own hand, our own house. it is emphatical, and
implies a silent contrariety or opposition; as, i live in my
own house, that is, not in a hired house. this i did with
my own hand, that is, without help, or not by proxy.
self is added to possessives, as myself, yourselves; and
sometimes to personal pronouns, as himself, itself, them-
selves. it then, like own, expresses emphasis and oppo-
sition, as i did this myself, that is, not another; or it
forms a reciprocal pronoun, as we hurt ourselves by vain
rage.
hinso/; its of themselves, is supposed by wallis to be put by cor-
ruption, for so self, it' /o/, theirselves; so that jeff is always a sub-
stantive. this seems justly observed, for we say, he came himself;
hinso/j%all do this ; where him/off cannot be an accusative.

there is another form of english verbs, in which the
infinitive mood is joined to the verb do in its various *-
fications, which are therefore to be learned in this place.
to do.
- indicative. present.
sing. i do ; thou dost; he doth ;
plur. we do ; ye do; toy do.
preferife.
sing. i did; thou didst 3 he did;
pir. we did; ye did ; they did.
preterite, &amp;c. i have done, &amp;c.

- imperative.
sing. do thou; let him do;
pir. let us do ; do ye; let them do.
conjunetive. present.
- sing. i do , thou do ; he do;
plur. isoe do; ye do ; they do.
the rest are as in the indicative.
infinitive. to do; to have done. -
participle pres. doing. partici, le preter. done.
i had done, &amp;c.
do is sometimes used superfluously, as, i do love, i
did love; simply for i love, or i loved; but this is consi-
dered as a vitious mode of speech.
it is sometimes used emphatically ; as,
i do love thee, and when i love thee not,
chaos is coine again. shakespeare.
it is frequently joined with a negative ; as, i like her,
but i do not love her; i wished him success, but did not
help him. this, by custom at least, appears more easy,
than the other form of expressing the same sense by a
negative adverb after the verb, i like her, but love her
il ot. -
the imperative prohibitory is soldom applied in the
second person, at least in prose, without the word do:
as, stop him, but do not litrl kim ; praje beauty, but do
not dote on it. -
its chief use is in interrogative forms of speech, in
which it is used through all the persons; as, do i live *
• dost thou strike me 2 :)o they rebel? . . )id i complain *
d.dit to a love her p did she die? so likewise in nega-
tive interrogations; do i not yet grieve * did she not die?
do and did are thus used only for the present and
simple preterize.
there is another manner of conjugating neuter verbs,
which, when it is used, may not improperly denominate
them neuter possives, as they are inflected according to
the passive form by the help of the verb substantive to be.
they answer nearly to the reciprocal verbs in french ;
as, o
i am rison, surrexi, latin; je me suis leve, french.
i was walked out, exicram; je m'etois promene.
in like manner we commonly express the present tense; as, i am
going, eo. i am grieving, deleo. she is dying, illa meritur. the
tempest is raging, furit procella. i am pursuing an enemy, hosen
insequor. so the other tenses, as, he were walking, iroyz o.p.s.
*…*.*, i have been walking, i had been walking, i shall or will
&amp;e walking.
there is another manner of using the acive participle, which
gives it a passive ignification ; as, the grammar is now printing,
grammatica jari nuoc chartis imprinitur. i he brass is forging, arra
excuduntar. this is, in my opinion, a vitious expression, pro-
...bably corrupted from a phrase more pure, but now somewhat obso-
lete : the book is a printing, 7% e /ra/, is a forging; a being properly
at, and printing and forging verbal nouns signifying action, according
to the analogy of this language.
the indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers fre-
quently confounded, or rather the conjunctive is wholly neglected,
when some convenience of versification does not invite its revival. it
is used among the purer writers of former times after if, though, ere,
before, till or until, whether, except, unk/$, whatsoever, whomsoever,
and words of withing; as, doubtle/; thou art our father, though abra-
han be ignorant of us, and israel acknowledge us not.
of i r r e g u l a r v e r b s.
the english verbs were divided by ben johnson into
four conjugations, without any reason arising from the
nature of the language, which has properly but one
conjugation, such as has been exemplified; from which
all deviations are to be considered as anomalies, which
are indeed in our monosyllable saxon verbs and the
verbs derived from them very frequent ; but almost all
the verbs which have been adopted from other languages,
follow the regular form.
our verbs are observed by dr. wallis to be irregular only in the
formation of the preterite, and its participle. indeed, in the scan-
tiness of our conjugations, there is scarcely any other place for irre-
gularity.
the first irregularity, is a slight deviation from
the regular form, by rapid utterance or poetical con-
trastion : the last syllable ed is often joined with the
former by suppression of e, as, lov'd for loved; after
c, ch, sh, f, k, x, and after the consonants s, th; when
more strongly pronounced, and sometimes after m, n,
r, if preceded by a short vowel, t is used in pronun-
ciation, but very seldom in writing, rather than d, as
plac’t, snatch't, fish't, wak’t, dwel"t, smel't for plac'd,
snatch'd, fish'd, wak'd, dwel'd, smel'd; or placed, sictched,
fished, waked, dwelled, smelled.
those words which terminate in l or ll, or p, make
their preterite in t, even in solemn language ; as crept,
felt, dwell ; sometimes after x, ed is changed into t ,
as, vext ; this is not constant.
a long vowel is often changed into a short one ; thus,
kept, slept, wept, crept, swept ; from the verbs, to keep,
to sleep, to weep, to creep, to sweep.
where d or t go before, the additional letter d or t,
in this contracted form, coalesce into one letter with the
radical d or t : if t were the radical, they coalesce into t ,
but if d were the radical, then into d or t, as the one or
the other letter may be more easily pronounced : as,
read, led, spread, shed, shred, bid, hid, chid, fed, l'd, bred,
sped, sirid, rid; from the verbs, to read, to lead, to
spread, to shed, to shread, to bid, to hide, to chido, to feed,
to bleed, to breed, to speed, to stride, to slide, to ride.
and thus, coff, hurt, coff, burst, eat, beat, socco', so,
quit, smit, writ, bit, lit, met, slot; from the verb-, to
cost, to hurt, to coff, to burst, to eat, to beat, to so...?,
to so, to quot, to smite, to write, to bite, to hit, to meet,
to shoot. and in like manner, leot, sent, reno, girt ;
from the verbs, to lend, to send, to rend, to grid.
the participle preterite or passive is often formed in
en, instead of ed; as been, taken, given, slain, known,
from the verbs to be, to take, to give, to say, to xuzzo.
many words have two or more participles, as not
only oritten, bitten, eaten, leaten, hidden, cloa.or, so ot-
ten, chosen, broken ; but likewise orit, bit, cat, foot,
hid, chid, slot, close, dro'c, are promiscuously used in
the participle, from the verbs to write, to lite, to ect,
to beat, to hide, to clide, to shoot, to choose, to break,
and many such like.
in the same manner son, sewn, heron, mazoo,
loaden, ladim, as well as sow'd, slow'd, hew'd, mow’d,
loaded, laded, from the verbs to sow, to so, to beco,
to mow, to lead, or lade. -
concerning these double participles it is difficult to
give any rule; but he shall seldom crt who remembers,
that when a verb has a participle distinet from its pre-
terite, as write, wrote, written, that distinct participle
is more proper and elegant, as i he back is written, is
better than she book is wrote. if rote however may be
used in poetry; at least if we allow any authority to
poets, who, in the exultation of genius, think themselves
perhaps intitled to trample on grammarians.
there are other anomalies in the preterite.
1. win, spin, begin, swim, strio, sick, so, song, fo,
ring, wring, spring, swing, d, ink, shk, sorink, you'.
come, run, find, bind, grind, wind, both in the pre-
terite imperfect and participle passive, give won, son,
begun, soum, siruck, fuck, sung, stars, fans, rung,
wrung, sprung, foung, drunk, sunk, shrunk, hung, come,
run, found, bound, ground, wound. and most of them
are also formed in the preterize by a, as logon, rang,
sang, sprang, drank, came, rao, and some others; but
most of these are now obsolete. some in the participle
passive likewise take co, as stricken, sirucker, drunken,
bounden.
2. fight, teach, recco, sock, beseech, catch, buy, bring,
think, work, make f to ht, tag!!, raight, sought, le-
sought, cargo, logo, orogo, to 24, wrogo.

but a great many of these retain likewise the regular

likewise formed by a, as brake, shake, lare, share,
soare, tare, care, clove, gat, boat, so go, and per-
haps some others, but more rarely. in the parti-
ciple passive are many of them formed by on, as
taken, shaken, frosen, broken, spoken, lorn, soro,
sworn, torm, wors, woven, cloven, thriven, drive”, rison,
smitten, ridden, chosen, tradi'en, gotten, logon, forgot-
ten, sodden. and many do likewise retain the analogy
in both, as waked, awaked, sleared, weaved, leaved,
alided, seethod.
4. give, bid, st, make in the preterite gave, lode,
sate; in the participle passive, given, bidden, sitten ; but
in both bid.

fly, slay, see, ly, make their preterite drew, know, greo,
threw, blew, crew, few, scow, saw, lay : their parti-
ciples passive by 11, drawn, known, groxon, throom,
blown, flown, sain, seen, lien, loin. yet from sco is
made fled; from go, went, from the old vend, the par-
ticiple is gone.
of d e r 1 v a t 1 o n.
that the english language may be more easily understood, it is
necessary to enquire how its derivative words are deduced from their
primitives, and how the primitives are borrowed from other lan-
guages. in this enquiry i shall sometimes copy dr. wallis, and
fometimes cndeavour to supply his defects, and restiy his errours.
nouns are derived from verbs.
the thing implied in the verb as done or produced,
is commonly either the present of the verb; as, to love,
love; to fright, a fright 5 to fight, a fight ; or the pre-
terite of the verb, as, to strike, i strick or strook, a siroke.
the action is the same with the participle present, as
joving, frighting, fghting, striking. -
the agent, or person acting, is denoted by the syl-
lable er added to the verb, as lover, frighter, striker.
substantives, adjectives, and sometimes other parts
of speech, are changed into verbs: in which case the
vowel is often lengthened, or the consonant softened;
as, a house, to house; brass, to braze ; glass, to glace ;
grass, to graze; price, to prize; breath, to breathe ; a
fish, to so; oyl, to cy!; further, to su ther ; forward,
to forward; hinder, to kinder.
sometimes the termination en is added, especially to
adjectives; as, haste, to hoslem , length, to lengthen ;
itrength, to sirengthen ; short, to shorted ; fast, to fasten ;
white, to whiten; black, to blacken ; hard, to harden ;
soft, to soften. -
frem substantives are formed adjectives of plenty, by
adding the termination y; as, a louse, lowly; wealth,
~cathy; health, healthy; might, mighty ; worth,
worthy; wit, witty; lust, lossy; water, watery; earth,
eartly ; wood, a wood, woody; air, aisy ; a heart,
hearty; a hand, handy.
from substantives are formed adjectives of plenty, by
adding the termination ful, denoting abundance ; as,
joy, josu!; fruit, fruitful; youth, youthful; care, care-
ful; use, useful; delight, desightful; plenty, plentiful;
help, helpful.
sometimes, in almost the same sense, but with some
kind of diminution thereof, the termination some is
added, denoting something, or in some degree; as, de-
light, desightsome 5 game, gamesoe ; irk, irksome ; bur-
den, lordosome , trouble, routosome 3 light, lightsome 3
hand, landsome ; alone, lonesome ; toil, to some.
on the contrary, the termination less added to sub-
fantives, makes adjeclives signifying want ; as worth-
loss, wit!ess, heartless, joysis, carels, helpless. thus
confort, comfortlys sap, sepoys.
privation or contrariety is very often denoted by the
particle un prefixed to many adjectives, or in before
words derived from the latin ; as, pleasint, unplea art;
wise, unwise; prostable, unprofitable ; patient, info-
tient. thus unworthy, un!eally, unfruitful, too,
and many more.
the original foolish privative is on ; bot as wrosion borrow from
the latin, or its descendants, words already sign:ring privation, as
inefficacious, inspious, iodoro, the insepar...!!e p.o. cicles on and in
have fallen into coufusion, from which it is not e.sy to disentangle
them.
un is prefixed to all words originally english, as untrue, untruto,
untaught, unhandsome.
un is prefixed to all participles made privative adjectives, as on.
feeling, unassisting, unaided, uraeighted, unend, area.
un ought never to be prefixed to a participle present, to mark a
forbearance of action, as unoglong ; but a privation of habit, as
upitying.
un is prefixed to most substantives which have an on lish termina-
tion, as unferileness, unpersecine/s, which, if they have borrowed
terminations, take in or im, as insertility, impovection ; wn... vil, in-
civility; una?ive, inactivity.
in borrowing adjectives, if we receive them already compounded,
it is usual to retain the particle prefixed, as inaccent, inciagart, in-
proper; but if we borrow the adjective, and add the privative par-
ticle, we commonly prefix un, as unpolite, urga...ant.
the prepositive particles dis and mis, derived from the
des and mes of the french, signify almost the same as un;
yet dis rather imports contrariety than privation, since it
answers to the latin preposition de. mis insinuates
some error, and for the most part may be rendered by
the latin words male or serperan. to like, to dissi'e ,
honour, disonour ; to honour, to grace, to disłonoor, to
disgrace; to deign, to dission ; chance, hop, misłance,
misoap ; to take, to mislake : deed, miod; to use, to
misuse ; to employ, to mysemploy ; to apply, to mis-
epply. -
words derived from latin written with do or dis re-
tain the same signification, as distinguis, ditinguo ; de-
trac, detraho ; defame, defamo; detain, detinco.
the termination ly added to substantives, and some-
times to adjectives, forms adjectives that import some
kind of similitude or agreement, being formed by con-
traction of lick or like. -
a giant, giently, giantlike; earth, cert’’; ; heaven,
heaven; ; world, worldly : god, godly ; good, goody.
the same termination y added to adjectives, forms
adverbs of like fignification; as, beautiful, beautifuly;
sweet, sweety ; that is, in a beautiful signific: ; with some
degree of sweetne 3.
the termination is added to adjectives, imports di-
minution; and added to substantives, imports simili-
tude or tendency to a character; as, green, green's
white, whitish ; soft, soft so ; a thief, toietish ; a wolf,
wo/vish ; a child, childso.
we have forms of diminutives in substantives, though
not frequent ; as, a hill, a billock ; a cock, a cockrel ; a
pike, pickrel ; this is a french termination: a goose,
a gossing ; this is a german termination : a limb, a
lambkin ; a chick, a chicken ; a man, a mani i ; a pipe,
a pipkin ; and thus haskin, whence the patronimick
iławkins; wilkin, tomcin, and others.
yet still there is another form of diminution among the foolish,
by lessening the sound itself, especially of vowels; as there is a form
of augmenting them by enlarging, or even lengthening it; and that
sometimes not so nuch by change of the letters, as of their pronun-
ciation; as, sop, sp, soft, so, spot, where, besides the extenu tin
of the vowel, there is added the french termination of ; too, to ;
spit, shout ; base, £ały, avoy, 3 of great pronounced long, especi-
ally if with a stronger found, grea-t; little pronounced long, lee-to
ting, tang, tong, imports a succession of smalier, and then greater
founds; and so in jingle, jangle, tingle, tangle, and many other made
words.
much however of this is arbitrary and fanciful, doorg to cn
oral utterance, and ther fore scarcely worthy the actice of jollis.
of concrete adjectives are made abstrast subston-
tives, by adding the termination mos, and a few in
hood or hecd, noting character or qualities; as, white,
whitems; ; hard, horinos : great, greatmeo skill ul,
soilfulness, tos.su.hts good', ongo'o, no do eat,
widowhood, knighthood, friesiod, likelihood, food.
there are other abstratts, partly derived from ad-
jectives, and partly from verbs, which are formed by
the addition of the termination th; a finall change be-
ing sometimes made ; as, long, length ; strong, strengo;
c broa',<br xmlns=""><br xmlns=""></p></div><div class="page"><div class="seq">page 64</div><p class="text">, a g r a m m a r o f t h e
.
broad, breadth; wide, width; deep, depth; true, truth;
warm, warmth; dear, dearth ; slow, slowth; merry,
mirth; heal, health; well, weal, wealth; dry, droughth ;
young, youth ; and so moon, month.
like these are some words derived from verbs; dy,
death; till, tilth 3 grow, growth; mow, later mowth,
after mow’th; commonly spoken and written later math,
after math ; steal, stealth ; bear, birth ; rue, ruth ; and
probably earth from to ear or plow; fly, fight ; weigh,
weight ; fray, fright ; to draw, draught.
these should rather be written fighth, frighth, only that custom
will not suffer h to be twice repeated.
the same form retain faith, spight, wreathe, wrath, broth, froth,
breath, sooth, worth, light, wight, and the like, whose primitives are
either entirely obsolete, or seldom cccur. perhaps they are derived
from soy or foy, spry, wry, wreak, trew, mow, fry, bray, say, work.
some ending in ship imply an office, employment,
or condition ; as, kingship, wardship, guardianship, part-
mership, stewardship, headship, lordship.
thus worship, that is, wort/ship; whence worshipful, and to worship.
some few ending in dom, rick, wick, do especially de-
note dominion, at least state or condition ; as kingdom,
dukedom, earldom, princedom, popedom, christendom, free-
dom, wisdom, whoredom, bishoprick, bailywick.
ment and age are plainly french terminations, and
are of the same import with us as among them, scarcely
ever occurring, except in words derived from the french,
as commandment, usage.
there are in english often long trains of words allied by their
meaning and derivation; as to beat, a bat, batoon, a lattie, a beetle,
a battle-door, to batter, batter, a kind of glutinous composition for
food, made by beating different bodies into one mass. all these are
of similar signification, and perhaps derived from the latin eatuo.
thus take, touch, tickle, tack, tackie ; all imply a local conjunction,
from the latin tango, tetigi, tacian.
from two are formed twain, twice, twenty, twelve, twins, twine,
twist, twirl, twig, twitch, twinge, between, betwixt, twilight, twieil.
the following remarks, extracted from wallis, are ingenious, but
of more subtlety than solidity, and such as perhaps might in every
language be enlarged without end.
sn usually imply the nose, and what relates to it. from the la-
tin nasus are derived the french mes and the english nose; and nose,
a promontory, as projecting like a nose. but as if from the conso-
nants ns taken from nasas, and transposed, that they may the better
correspond, sn denote nasus ; , and thence are derived many words
that relate to the nose, as sicut, sneeze, snore, short, shear, snicker,
shot, snevil shite, snuff, shuffle, snaffe, snarle, shudge.
there is another sn, which may perhaps be derived from the latin
sinuo, as snake, sneak, jnail, jhare; so likewise snap and snatch, snic,
hub.
j. bl imply a blast; as, blow, blast, to bloff, to blight, and, meta-
phorically, to blast one's reputation; bleat, bleak, a bleak place, to
jook bleak or weather beaten, &amp;leak, blay, bleach, blufter, blurt, blisher,
&amp;lah, bladder, bleh, alisler, blabber-lip't, blubber-cheek’t, bloted, blote-
herrings, llas, blaze, to blow, that is, blossom, bloom ; and perhaps
blood and blush.
in the native words of our tongue is to be found a great agree-
ment between the letters and the thing signified ; and therefore the
sounds of letters smaller, sharper, louder, closer, softer, stronger,
clearer, more obscure, and more stridulous, do very often intimate
the like effects in the things signified.
thus words that begin with sor intimate the force and effect of
the thing fignified, as if probably derived from roorool, or strenuus ;
as, strong, strength, strew, strike, streake, /roke, stripe, strive, sirise,
struggle, strout, sirut, stretch, strait, strict, foreight, that is, narrow,
disirain, sires, disłres, soring, strop, sireaza, streamer, / rand, strip,
fray, struggle, strange, stride, straddle.
st in like manner imply strength, but in a less degree, so much
only as is sufficient to preserve what has been already communi-
cated, rather than acquire any new degree ; as if it were derived
from the latin so : for example, sland, say, that is, to remain, or to
prop; staff, say, that is, to oppose; stop, to suff, softe, to say, that
is, to stop; a slay, that is, an obstacle; slick, sout, slutter, slammer,
stagger, fickle, sick, s'ase, a sharp pale, and any thing deposited
at play; stock, stem, sing, to sing, sink, slitch, stud, sanchion,
foub, stubble, to sub up, stump, whence slumble, stalk, to falk, /*p,
to stamp with the feet, whence to stamp, that is, to make an impression
and a stamp ; slow, to sow, to losow, steward or stoward, stead,
steady, steadfast, sable, a stable, a shall, to stall, stool, shall, still, stall,
słallage, stall, stage, fill adj. and still adv, sale, sout, sourdy, sleed,
foat, stallion, stiff, sark-dead, to starve with hunger or cold; soone,
feel, stern, sanch, to stanch blood, to slare, steep, steeple, fair, sian-
dard, a flated measure, stately. in all these, and perhaps some
others, so denote something firm and fixed.
thr imply a more violent degree of motion, as 'throw, thruff,
throng, throb, through, threat, threater, thrall, throws.
wr imply some sort of obliquity or distortion, as wry, to wreathe,
wrest, wrestle, wring, wrong, wrinch, wrench, wrangle, wrinkle,
wrath, wreak, wrack, wretch, wrist, wrap.
sw imply a filent agitation, or a softer kind of lateral motion; as
joway, sowag, to sway, swagger, swerve, sweat, sweep, swill, swim,
jowing, swift, sweet, switch, swinge,
nor is there much difference of son in smoothe, song, smile, sor},
jonito, which signifies the same as to arike, but is a softer word; /nal,
jones, snack, /mother, smart, a smart blow properly signifies such a kind
of stroke as with an originally silent motion implied in son, proceeds
. a quick violence, denoted by ar suddenly ended, as is shewn
y t.
cl denote a kind of adhesion or tenacity, as in cleave, clay, cłng,
climb, ciamaer, clammy, clasp, to clasp, to clip, to clinch, cloak, og,
close, to cose, a clad, a clot, as a clot of blood, cloured cream, a cli.
ter, a cliffer.
so imply a kind of diffipation or expansion, especially a quick
one, particularly if there be an r, as if it were from spargo or / paro:
for example, spread, spring, jorig, sprout, sprinkle, æsir, jelinter, spill,
joit, soutter, spatter.
s! denote a kind of silent fall, or a less observable motion; as in
so jide, sop, /pper, joy, /eight, /sit, slow, joaca, s/ght, sing,
j/4 -
and so likewise ash, in crash, raso, ga/, flash, clash, la/, /a/,
pla/, traso, indicate something acting more nimbly and sharply.
but u/, in crush, rush, gush, flush, blush, bruso, hu/, push, implies
something as acting more obtusely and dully. yet in both there is
indicated a swift and sudden motion, not instantaneous, but gradual,
by the continued sound /h.
thus in fling, sling, ding, swing, cling, song, wring, sing, the ting-
ling of the termination ng, and the sharpness of the vowel i, imply
the continuation of a very slender motion or tremor, at length indeed
vanithing, but not suddenly interrupted. but in tink, wink, so,
clink, think, think, that end in a mute consonant, there is also indi-
cated a sudden ending.
if there be an l, as in jingle, tingle, tinkle, mingle, sprinkle,
twinkle, there is implied a frequency, or iteration of small acts. and
the same frequency of acts, but less subtile by reason of the clearer
vowel a, is indicated in jan, le. tangle, spangle, mangle, wrangle,
&amp;rangle, dangle; as also in mumble, grumble, jumble, tumee, stumble,
roble, crown//e, foole. but at the same time the close u implies
something obscure or obtunded ; and a congeries of consonants mel,
denotes a confused kind of rolling or tumbling, as in ramble,
jamale, jiraole, waxos., arole ; but in these there is something
a cult c.
in mizole, the acuteness of the vowel denotes celerity. in sparkle,
sp denotes dissipation, ar an acute crackling, 4 a sudden interruption,
1 a frequent iteration; and in like manner in sprinkle, unless in may
imply the subtility of the dislipated guttules. thick and thin differ,
in that the former ends with an obtuse consonant, and the later
with an acute.
in like manner, in soueek, soueak, sueal, sual, &amp;raul, scrawl, yaul.
joaul, screek, soreek, soril, sharp, shrives, wrinkle, crack, croso, clas”,
gaa/. aloft, cru/, /t/, offe, fift, whift, soft, jarr, hurl, curl,
whirl, buz, biosile, spindle, dowindle, twine, twis, and in many more,
we may observe the agreement of such sort of sounds with the things
signified : and this so frequently happens, that scarce any language
which i know can be compared with ours. so that one mono-
syllable word, of which kind are almost all ours, emphatically
expresses what in other languages can scarce be explained but by
compounds, or decompounds, or sometimes a tedious circumlo-
cult!cil.
we have many words borrowed from the latin; but
the greatest part of them were communicated by the
intervention of the french ; as grace, face, elegant, ele-
gance, resemble.
some verbs, which seem borrowed from the latin,
are formed from the present tense, and some from the
supines.
from the present are formed spond, expend, expendo ;
conduce, conduco; despise, despicio; approve, approbo ;
conceive, conciplo.
from the supines, stopplicate, supplico; demonstrate,
demonstro ; dispose, dispono ; expatiate, expation ; sup-
press, supprimo ; exempt, eximo.
nothing is more apparent, than that wallis goes too far in quest
of originals. many of these which seem selected as immediate de-
scendents from the latin, are apparently french, as conceive, approve,
expose, exempt.
some words purely french, not derived from the
latin, we have transferred into our language; as, gar-
den, garter, buckler, to advance, to cry, to plead, from the
french jardin, jartier, bouclicr; avancer, cryer, plaider;
though indeed, even of these, part is of latin original.
as to many words which we have in common with the germans,
it is doubtful whether the old teutons borrowed them from the la-
tins, or the latins from the teutons, or both had them from some
common original; as, wine, vinum; wind, ventus; went, veni ;
way, via ; wall, vallum ; wallow, volvo; wool, vellus; will, volo :
worm, vermis; worte, virtus; wasp, vespa; day, dies; draw, traho;
tarie, domo, oxo~ ; yoke, jugum, @ya; ; over, upper, super, 57: ;
am, fum, to ; break, frango; fly, volo ; blow, flo. i make no
doubt but the teutonick is more ancient than the latin: and it is
no less certain, that the latin, which borrowed a great number of
words, not only from the greek, especially the aeolick, but from
other neighbouring languages, as the oscan and others, which have
long become obsolete, received not a few from the teutonick. it is
certain, that the english, german, and other teutonick languages,
retained some derived from the greek, which the latin has not ; as<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">

ux, acks, mit, ford, pfurd, daughter, tochter, rickle, mingle, moon,
jear, grave, graff, to grave, to scrape, whole, from 23%, wilz,
accoues, $9742;. o, ove, porn, otos, zoo, 3xes. since they
received these immediately from the greeks, without the intervention
of the latin language, why may not other words be derived imme-
diately from the same fountain, though they be likewise found
among the latins f
our ancestors were studious to form borrowed words,
however long, into monosyllables; and not only cut
off the formative terminations, but cropped the first syl-
lable, especially in words beginning with a vowel ; and
rejected not only vowels in the middle, but likewise
consonants of a weaker found, retaining the stronger,
which seem the bones of words, or changing them for
others of the same organ, in order that the found might
become the softer ; but especially transposing their order,
that they might the more readily be pronounced with-
out the intermediate vowels. for example, in expendo,
spend; exemplum, sample ; excipio, scape; extraneus,
strange; extractum, stretch'd; excrucio, to screw; ex-
scorio, to scour; excorio, to scourge ; excortico, to
fcratch ; and others beginning with ex: as also, emen-
do, to mend; episcopus, bishop; in danish, bisp ; epi-
stola, pistle; hospitale, spittle ; hispania, spain; histo-
ria, story.
many of these etymologies are doubtful, and some evidently
mistaken.
the following are somewhat harder, alexander, sander; elisabetha,
fetty; apis, bee; aper, bar; p passing into b, as in bisoop ; and by
cutting of a from the beginning, which is restored in the middle :
but for the old bar or bare, we now say boar; as for lang, long ; for
bain, bane; for sane, stone; aprugna, brawn, p being changed into 6,
and a transposed, as in aper, and g changed into w, as in pignus,
pawn ; lege, law; 2xo, sex ; cutting off the beginning, and
changing pinto y, as in pellis, a fell; pullus, a foal ; pater, father;
pavor, fear; polio, file; pleo, impleo, fill, full; piscis, fish ; and
transposing o into the middle, which was taken from the beginning;
apex, a piece; peak, pike; zophorus, freese ; mustum, stum ; defensio,
fence; dispensator, spencer; asculto, escouter, fr. j. out ; exscalpo,
scrape, restoring l instead of r, and hence scrap, scrack, scrawl;
exculpo, scoop; exterritus, start ; extonitus, attonitus, soonm'd; sto-
machus, maw; offendo, fined; obitipo, stop ; audere, dare : ca-
were, ware, whence a-ware, be-ware, wary, warn, warning; for
the latin v consonant formerly sounded like our w, and the mo-
dern sound of the v consonant was formerly that of the letter f. that
is, the aeolick digamma, which had the sound of p, and the mo-
dern sound of the letterf was that of the greek p or £h; ulcus,
ulcere, ulcer, sore, and hence sorry, sorrow, sorrowful; ingenium,
engine, gin ; scalenus, leaning, unless you would rather derive it
from xx…, whence inclino; infundibulum, funnel; gogates, jett;
projectum, to jet forth, a jetty ; cucullus, a cowl.
there are syncopes somewhat harder; from tempore, time; from
nomine, name; domina, dame; as the french homme, femme, nom,
from homine, foemina, nomine. thus pagina, page; wsinger, pot ;
zvaixxx, cup ; cantharus, can ; tentorium, tent; precor, pray :
praeda, prey; specio, speculor, spy; plico, psy; implico, imply ; re-
plico, reply ; complico, comply; sedes episcopalis, see.
a vowel is also cut off in the middle, that the number of the syl-
lables may be lessened; as, amita, aunt ; spiritus, spright ; debi-
tum, debt; dubito, aoubt; comes, comitis, count ; clericus, clerk ;
quietus, quit, quite: acquieto, to acquit separo, to spare ; stabilis,
fable; stabulum, stable; pallacium, palace, place ; rabula, rail,
rawl, wraal, brawl, rable, &amp;rable ; quaesitio, ques?.
as also a consonant, or at least one of a softer sound, or even a
whole syllable; rotundus, round; fragilis, frail ; securus, sure; re-
gula, rule; tegula, tile; subtilis, subtle, nomen, noun; decanus, dean ;
computo, count; subitaneus, sadaain, soon ; superare, to scar; peri-
culum, peril; mirabile, marvel; as magnus, main ; dignor, deign ;
tingo, slain ; tinctum, taint ; pingo, paint ; praedari, reach.
the contractions may seem harder, where many of them meet,
as xv, xx}, , kyrk, church; presbyter, pries?; , sacristanus, sexton ;
frango, fregi, break, breach ; fagus, paya, beech, f changed into
, and g into ch, which are letters, near a-kin; frigesco, freeze ;
frigesco, fresh, so in so, as above in bishop, fish, so in scapha, soiff,
feip, and refrigesco, refresh; but viresco, fresh; phlebotomus, feam;
bovina, beef, vitulina, veal; scutifer, suire; poenitentia, penance;

some may seem harsher, yet may not be rejected, for it at lead
appears, that some of them are derived from proper names, and
there are others whose etymology is acknowledged by every body;

elizabeth, elisabeth, betty, bos; , margareta, argaret, marget,

month july ; petroselinum, pariy; portulaca, purs’.” ; cydonium,
quince ; cydoniatum, quiaceny; perficum, peach ; eruca, eruke, which
they corrupt to ear-wig, as if it took its name from the car; annulus
geminus, a gimnal or gimbal ring ; and thus the word giroal and
jumbal is transferred to other things thus interwoven ; quelques
choses, kickshaws. since the origin of these, and many others,
however forced, is evident, it ought to appear no wonder to any
one if the ancients have thus disfigured many, especially as they so
much affested monosyllables; and, to make them found the softer,
took this liberty of maining, taking away, changing, transposing,
and softening them.
but while we derize these from the latin, i do not mean to say,
that many of them did not immediately come to us from the saxon,
danish, dutch, and 1 eutonick languages, and other dialects, and
some taken more lately from the french or italians, or spaniards.
the same word, according to its different significations, often has
a different origin; as, to £ear a burden, from fero; but to bear, whence
birth, born, #. comes from pario; and a boar, at least if it be of
latin of iginal, from fora. thus perch, a fish, from perca; but
perch, a measure, from pertica, and likewise to perch. 70 spell is
from /;llada ; but shell, an inchantment, by which it is believed that
the boundaries are so fixed in lands, that none can pass them against
the master's will, from expello; and spell, a messenger, from episola;
whence gospel, good spel, or god-spell. thus freese, or freeze, from fri-
gesco ; but freeze, an architectonic word, from zophorus; but freese,
for cloth, from frisia, or perhaps from forgosco, as being more fit
than any other for keeping out the cold.
there are many words among us, even monosyllables, compounded
of two or more words, at least serving instead of compounds, and
comprising the signification of more words than one; as, from
strip and roll comes scroll; from proud and dance, prance ; from so,
of the verb stay or stand and out, is made stout; from shout and
aardy, sturdy ; from sp of soit or shew, and out, comes shout ; from
the same so, with the termination in, is spin ; and adding out, spin
su: ; and from the same sp, with it, is spit, which only differs from
spout in that it is smaller, and with less noise and force; but sputter
is, because of the obscure u, something between spit and spout; and
by reason of adding r, it intimates a frequent iteration and noise,
but obscurely confused: whereas spatter, on account of the sharper
and clearer vowel a, intimates a more distinct noise, in which it
chiefly differs from sputer. from the same so, and the termination
ark, comes spark, figuifying a single emission of fire with a noise;
namely, so the emission, ar the more acute noise, and k, the mate
consonant, intimates its being suddenly terminated ; but adding 1, is
made the frequentative sparkie. the same sp, by adding r, that is
spr, implies a more lively impetus of diffusing or expanding itself;
to which adding the termination ing, it becomes spring; its vi-
gour spr imports, its sharpness the termination ing, and lastly in
acute and tremulous, ends in the mute consonant g, denotes the
sudden ending of any motion, that it is meant in its primary signifi-
cation, of a single, not a complicated exilition. hence we call spring
whatever has an elastick force ; as also a fountain of water, and
thence the origin of any thing ; and to spring, to germinate; and
jpring, one of the four seasons. from the same spr and out, is formed
%. and with the termination ig, sprig ; of which the following,
or the most part, is the difference: sprout, of a grosser sound, im-
ports a fatter or crosser bud; sprig, of a slenderer sound, denotes a
smaller shoot. in like manner, from sor of the verb frowe, and out,
comes strout and sirut. from the same sir, and the termination
aggle, is made struggle ; and this glimports, but without any great
noise, by reason of the obscure sound of the vowel u. in like man-
ner, from throw and roll is made trull ; and almost in the same sense
is trundle, from throw or thrus?, and rundle. thus graff or grough is
compounded of grave and rough; and trudge from read or irot, and
drudge.
in these observations it is easy to discover great saga-
city and great extravagance, an ability to do much de-
feated by the desire of doing more than enough. it
may be remarked,
1. that wallis's derivations are often so made, that
by the same licence any language may be deduced from
any other.
2. that he makes no distinetion between words imme-
diately derived by us from the latin, and those which
being copied from other languages, can therefore afford
no example of the genius of the english language, or
its laws of derivation.
3. that he derives from the latin, often with great
harshness and violence, words apparently teutonick;
and therefore, according to his own declaration, pro-
bably older than the tongue to which he refers them.
4. that some of his derivations are apparently erro-
intculs.

the established practice of grammarians requires that i should here
treat of the syntax; but our language has so little inflection, or va-
riety of terminations, that its construction neither requires nor ad;
mits many rules. wallis therefore has totally neglected it : and
johnson, whose defire of following the writers, upon the learned lan-
guages made him think a syntax indispensably necessary, has pub-
lished such petty observations as were better omitted.
the verb, as in other languages, agrees with the no-
minative in number and person ; as, thou fift from
good; he runs to death.
our adjectives and pronouns are invariable.
of two substantives the noun possessive is the geni-
tive ; as, his father’s glory ; the sun's heat.
verbs transitive require an oblique case; as, he loves
me; you fear him.
all prepositions require an oblique case: he gave this
to me; he took this from me; he says this of me ; he
came with me.
p r o s o d y.
it is common for those that deliver the grammar of modern lan-
guages, to omit their prosody. so that of the italians is neglected
by eaomattei'; that of the french by domarai; ; and that of the
english by if allis, cooper, and even by johnson though a poet. but
as the laws of metre are included in the idea of a grammar, i have
thought it proper to insert them.
prosody comprises orthophy, or the rules of pronun-
ciation; and orthometry, or the laws of versification.
pronu nciation is just, when every letter has its
proper sound, and when every syllable has its proper
accent, or which in english versification is the fame,
its proper quantity.
the sounds of the letters have been already explained; and rules
for the accent or quantity are not easily to be given, being subject to
innumerable exceptions. such however as i have read or formed, i
shall here propose.
1. of disyllables formed by asfixing a termination,
the former syllable is commonly accented, as childish,
kingdom, 4:left, dosed, toisome, lover, scoffer, fairer,
foremoff, zealous, fulness, godly, meekly, artist.
2. disyllables formed by prefixing a syllable to the
radical word, have commonly the accent on the latter;
as, to beget, to bese&amp;m, to bow.
3. of diffyllables, which are at once nouns and verbs,
the verb has commonly the accent on the latter, and the
noun on the former syllable ; as, to descant, a descant ;
to cemant, a cement ; to contreo, a contraci.
this rule has many exceptions. though verbs seldom have their
accent on the former, yet nouns often have it on the latter syllable;
as, delight, poss me.
4. all disolables ending in y, as cranny; in our, as
labour, favour; in ow, as willow, willow, except allow;
in le, as bittle, lible; in ish, as binish; in co, as cam-
brick, coffock ; in ter, as to bitter ; in age, as colorage; in
en, as fosten; in et, as quict, accent the former syllable.
5. disyllable nouns in er, as canker, botter; have
the accent on the former syllable.
6. disyllable verbs terminating in a consonant and
e final, as comprise, escope; or having a diphthong in
the last syllable, as appease, reveal; or ending in two
consonants, as attend, have the accent on the latter syl-
lable.
7. dissyllable nouns having a diphthong in the latter
syllable, have commonly their accent on the latter syl-
lable, as applasse ; except words in ain, certain, motin-
tain.
8. trisyllables formed by adding a termination, or
prefixing a syllable, retain the accent of the radical
word, as loveliness, tenderness, comtemner, ogonner, phy-
fical, bespatter, commenting, commending, assurance.
9. trissyllables ending in ous, as gracious, drauous;
in al, as ce; ital; in ion, as mantion, accent the first.
io. trisyllables ending in ce, ent, and ate, accent the
first syllable, as colontenance, continence, armament, immi-
ment, legant, prepagate, except they be derived from
words having the accent on the last, as connavence, ac-
queintance; or the middle syllable hath a vowel before
two consonants, as promtsoate.
11. trisyllables ending in y, as ensity, specisy, liberty,
vioory, softly, commonly accent the first syllable.
12. trissyllables in re or le accent the first syllable, as
ligible, theatre, except disciple, and some words which
have a position, as ex. nole, episoe.
13. trisyllables in ude cominonly accent the first syl-
lable, as flenitude.
14. trisyllables ending in ator or a cur, as crestator,
or having in the middle lyilable a diphthong, as endo-
vour; or a vowel before two consonants, as domstick,
accent the middle syllable.
15. trisyllables that have their accent on the last syl-
lable are commonly french, as acquisce, repartie, pia-
gazine, or words formed by prelixing one or two syl-
lables to an acute syllable, as immature, overcolorge.
16. polysyllables, or words of more than three syl-
lables, follow the accent of the words from which they
are derived, as or oios, continocy, incontinenty, com-
mendable, commonical or so. we slo. the resore fly
dispotable, indiffioelle, rather than diocle, ind ou.-
able; and advertisemco rather than odvortisoco.
17. words in in hive the accent upon the ante-
penult, as salvition, persitrotic”, concoction; words in
atcur or ctor on the coult, as doctor.
18. words ending in le commonly have the accent
on the first syllable, as to ico, unless the second s. 1-
lable have a vowel before two consonants, as con-
bûible.
19. words ending in roo have the accent on the as:c-
penult, as usdrico, o f foots.
20. words ending in ly have their accent on the an-
tepenult, as positionisy, a.o. city.

posed as useful. anoo overy role of every lon, case his is ex —

that have escaped my cost rvation.
versification is the arrangement of a certain num-
ber of syllables according to certain laws.
the feet of our verses are either iambick, as also,
credite; or trochaick, as boy, loy.
our iambick measure comprises verses
of four syllables,

in all these measures the accents are to be placed on
even syllables; and every line considered by itself is more
harmonious, as this rule is more strictly observed. the
variations necessary to pleasure belong to the art of poetry,
not the rules of grammar.
our trochaick measures are
of three syllables,
here we may
think and pray,
before death

other joys

of five,
in the days of old,

of seven,

urge not thus your haughty birth. waller.
in these measures the accent is to be placed on the odd
syllables.
these are the measures which are now in use, and above the rest
those of seven, eight, and ten syllables. our ancient poets wrote
“to sometimes of twelve syllabies, as drayton's polyolbion.

were cruelly inforc'd, her mountains did relieve
those whom devouring war else every where did grieve.
and when all wales beside (by fortune or by might)
unto her ancient foe resign'd her ancient right,
a constant maiden still she only did remain,
the last her genuine laws which stoutly did retain.
and as each one is prais'd for her peculiar things;
so only she is rich, in mountains, meres, and springs,
and holds herself as great in her superfluous waste,
as others by their towns, and fruitful tillage grac'd,
and of fourteen, as chapman's homer.
and as the mind of such a man, that hath a long way gone,
and either knoweth not his way, or else would let alone
his purpos'd journey, is distract.
the measures of twelve and fourteen syllables, were often mingled
by our old poets, sometimes in alternate lines, and sometimes in al-
ternate couplets.
the verse of twelve lines, called an alexandrine, is now only used
to diversify heroick lines.
waller was smooth, but dryden taught to join
the varying verse, the full-resounding line, }
the long majestick march, and energy divine. pope,
the pause in the alexandrine must be at the fixth syllable.
the verse of fourteen syllables is now broken into a soft lyrick mea-
sure of verses, consisting alternately of eight syllables and fix.

but not more innocent.
when the archangel’s trump shall blow,
and souls to bodies join,

had been as short as thine. hosoy,
we have another measure very quick and lively, and therefore
much used in songs, which may be called the anapestick, in which the
accent rests upon every third syllable.
may i gevern my passions with absolute sway,
and grow wiser and better as life wears away. dr. pope.
in this measure a syllable is often retrenched from the first foot, as
diogenes surly and prond. dr. pope.
when present, we lave, and when absent agree,
i think not of i'ris, nor i'ris of me. dryden
these measures are varied by many combinations, and sometimes
by double endings, either with or without rhyme, as in the heroick
measure.
'tis the divinity that stirs within us,
'tis heav'n itself that points out an hereafter,
and intimates eternity to man. addison.
so in that of eight syllables,
they neither added nor confounded,
they neither wanted nor abounded.

but with twenty ships had done,
what thou, brave and happy vernon,
hast atchiev’d with fix alone. glazer.
in that of six,
'twas when the seas were roaring,

a damsel lay deploring,
all on a rock reclin’d.
in the anapestick,
when terrible tempests assail us,
and mountainous billows affright,
nor power nor wealth can avail us,
but skilful industry steers right. ballad.
to these measures, and their laws, may be reduced every species of
english verse.
our versification admits of few licences, except a
synalapha, or elision of e in the before a vowel, as th’eter-
mal; and more rarely of o in to, as taccept; and a sy-
nacresis, by which two short vowels coalesce into one
syllable, as question, special; or a word is contracted by
the expulsion of a short vowel before a liquid, as avorite,
temp'rance.
