2uicksilver, called mercury by the chymists, is a naturally
fluid mineral, and the heaviest of all known bodies next to
gold, and is the more heavy and fluid, as it is more pure ; it
is wholly volatile in the fire, and may be driven up in vapour
by a degree of heat very little greater than that of boiling
water: it is the least tenacious of all bodies, and every smaller
drop may be again divided by the lightest touch into a multi-
tude of others, the specifick gravity of pure mercury is to
water as 14ozo to iooo, and as it is the heaviest of all fluids,
it is also the coldest, and when heated the hottest: the an-
cients all esteemed quicksilver a poison, nor was it brought into
internal use till about two hundred and twenty years ago,
which was first occasioned by the shepherds, who ventured
to give it their sheep to kill worms, and as they received no
hurt by it, it was soon concluded, that men might take it
safely: in time, the diggers in the mines, when they found
it crude, swallowed it in vast quantities, in order to sell it
privately, when they had voided it by stool : but the miners
seldom follow their occupation above three or four years, and
the artificers, who have much dealing in it, are generally
seized with paralytick disorders, płill's materia medica.
mercury is very improperly called a metal, for though it
has weight and similarity of parts, it is neither dissolvable by
fire, malleable nor j. it seems to constitute a particular
class of fossils, and is rather the mother or basis of all metals,
than a metal itself: mercury is of considerable use in gilding,
making looking-glasses, in refining gold, and various other
mechanical operations besides medicine. chambers.
