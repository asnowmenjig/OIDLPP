the heart and as it is perceived by the touch
pulse is thus accounted for when the left ventricle of the
heart contracts and throws its blood into the great artery the
blood in the artery is not only thrust forward towards the
extremities but the channel of the artery is likewise dilated 
when the impetus of the blood against the sides of the artery
ceases that is when the left ventricle ceases to contract
then the spiral fibres of the artery by their natural elasticity
return again to their former state and contract the channel
of the artery till it is again dilated by the diastole of the
heart this diastole of the artery is called its pulse and the
time the spiral fibres are returning to their natural state is
the distance between two pulses  this pulse is in all the arte
ries of the body at the same time an high pulse is either ve
hement or strong but if the dilatation of the artery does not
rise to its usual height it is called a low or weak pulse  but
if between its dilatations there passes more time than usual
it is called a slow pulse again if the coats of an artery feel
harder than usual from any cause whatsoever it is called an
hard pulse but if by any contrary cause they are softer then
it is called a soft pulse quincy
