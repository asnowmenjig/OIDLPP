 in astronomy 
libration is the balancing motion or trepidation in the fir
mament whereby the declination of the sun and the latitude
of the stars change from time to time astronomers like
wise ascribe to the moon a libratory motion or motion of tre
pidation which they pretend is from east to west and from
north to south because that at full moon they sometimes
discover parts of her disk which are not discovered at other
times these kinds are called the one a libration in longi
tude and the other a libration in latitude besides this there
is a third kind which they call an apparent libration and
which consists in this that when the moon is at her greatest
elongation from the south her axis being then almost perpen
dicular to the plane of the ecliptick the sun must enlighten
towards the north pole of the moon some parts which he did
not before and that on the contrary some parts of those
which he enlightened towards the opposite pole are obscured 
and this produces the same effeampt which the libration in lati
tude does dicf trev

logarithms which are the indexes of the ratios of numbers

son a scottish baron and afterwards completed by mr
briggs savilian professor at oxford they are a series of
artincial numbers contrived for the expedition of calculation
and proceeding in an arithmetical proportion as the numbers
they answer to do in a geometrical one  for instance
o 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
i 2 8 16 32 64 128 256 512
where the numbers above beginning with o and arith
metically proportional are called logarithms the addition
and subtraction of logarithms answers to the multiplication and
division of the numbers they correspond with  and this saves
an infinite deal of trouble in like manner will the extrac

numbers for the square root and trisecting them for the cube
